preface to the first german edition marx the work the first volume of which i now submit to the public forms the continuation of my zur kritik der politischen oekonomie a contribution to the criticism of political economy published in the long pause between the first part and the continuation is due to an illness of many years’ duration that again and again interrupted my work the substance of that earlier work is summarised in the first three chapters of this volume this is done not merely for the sake of connexion and completeness the presentation of the subject matter is improved as far as circumstances in any way permit many points only hinted at in the earlier book are here worked out more fully whilst conversely points worked out fully there are only touched upon in this volume the sections on the history of the theories of value and of money are now of course left out altogether the reader of the earlier work will find however in the notes to the first chapter additional sources of reference relative to the history of those theories every beginning is difficult holds in all sciences to understand the first chapter especially the section that contains the analysis of commodities will therefore present the greatest difficulty that which concerns more especially the analysis of the substance of value and the magnitude of value i have as much as it was possible popularised the valueform whose fully developed shape is the moneyform is very elementary and simple nevertheless the human mind has for more than years sought in vain to get to the bottom of it all whilst on the other hand to the successful analysis of much more composite and complex forms there has been at least an approximation why because the body as an organic whole is more easy of study than are the cells of that body in the analysis of economic forms moreover neither microscopes nor chemical reagents are of use the force of abstraction must replace both but in bourgeois society the commodityform of the product of labour – or valueform of the commodity – is the economic cellform to the superficial observer the analysis of these forms seems to turn upon minutiae it does in fact deal with minutiae but they are of the same order as those dealt with in microscopic anatomy with the exception of the section on valueform therefore this volume cannot stand accused on the score of difficulty i presuppose of course a reader who is willing to learn something new and therefore to think for himself the physicist either observes physical phenomena where they occur in their most typical form and most free from disturbing influence or wherever possible he makes experiments under conditions that assure the occurrence of the phenomenon in its normality in this work i have to examine the capitalist mode of production and the conditions of production and exchange corresponding to that mode up to the present time their classic ground is england that is the reason why england is used as the chief illustration in the development of my theoretical ideas if however the german reader shrugs his shoulders at the condition of the english industrial and agricultural labourers or in optimist fashion comforts himself with the thought that in germany things are not nearly so bad i must plainly tell him “de te fabula narratur” it is of you that the story is told – horace intrinsically it is not a question of the higher or lower degree of development of the social antagonisms that result from the natural laws of capitalist production it is a question of these laws themselves of these tendencies working with iron necessity towards inevitable results the country that is more developed industrially only shows to the less developed the image of its own future but apart from this where capitalist production is fully naturalised among the germans for instance in the factories proper the condition of things is much worse than in england because the counterpoise of the factory acts is wanting in all other spheres we like all the rest of continental western europe suffer not only from the development of capitalist production but also from the incompleteness of that development alongside the modern evils a whole series of inherited evils oppress us arising from the passive survival of antiquated modes of production with their inevitable train of social and political anachronisms we suffer not only from the living but from the dead le mort saisit le vif the dead holds the living in his grasp – formula of french common law the social statistics of germany and the rest of continental western europe are in comparison with those of england wretchedly compiled but they raise the veil just enough to let us catch a glimpse of the medusa head behind it we should be appalled at the state of things at home if as in england our governments and parliaments appointed periodically commissions of inquiry into economic conditions if these commissions were armed with the same plenary powers to get at the truth if it was possible to find for this purpose men as competent as free from partisanship and respect of persons as are the english factoryinspectors her medical reporters on public health her commissioners of inquiry into the exploitation of women and children into housing and food perseus wore a magic cap down over his eyes and ears as a makebelieve that there are no monsters let us not deceive ourselves on this as in the th century the american war of independence sounded the tocsin for the european middle class so that in the th century the american civil war sounded it for the european working class in england the process of social disintegration is palpable when it has reached a certain point it must react on the continent there it will take a form more brutal or more humane according to the degree of development of the working class itself apart from higher motives therefore their own most important interests dictate to the classes that are for the nonce the ruling ones the removal of all legally removable hindrances to the free development of the working class for this reason as well as others i have given so large a space in this volume to the history the details and the results of english factory legislation one nation can and should learn from others and even when a society has got upon the right track for the discovery of the natural laws of its movement – and it is the ultimate aim of this work to lay bare the economic law of motion of modern society – it can neither clear by bold leaps nor remove by legal enactments the obstacles offered by the successive phases of its normal development but it can shorten and lessen the birthpangs to prevent possible misunderstanding a word i paint the capitalist and the landlord in no sense couleur de rose ie seen through rosetinted glasses but here individuals are dealt with only in so far as they are the personifications of economic categories embodiments of particular classrelations and classinterests my standpoint from which the evolution of the economic formation of society is viewed as a process of natural history can less than any other make the individual responsible for relations whose creature he socially remains however much he may subjectively raise himself above them in the domain of political economy free scientific inquiry meets not merely the same enemies as in all other domains the peculiar nature of the materials it deals with summons as foes into the field of battle the most violent mean and malignant passions of the human breast the furies of private interest the english established church eg will more readily pardon an attack on of its articles than on of its income nowadays atheism is culpa levis a relatively slight sin cf mortal sin as compared with criticism of existing property relations nevertheless there is an unmistakable advance i refer eg to the blue book published within the last few weeks “correspondence with her majesty’s missions abroad regarding industrial questions and trades’ unions” the representatives of the english crown in foreign countries there declare in so many words that in germany in france to be brief in all the civilised states of the european continent radical change in the existing relations between capital and labour is as evident and inevitable as in england at the same time on the other side of the atlantic ocean mr wade vicepresident of the united states declared in public meetings that after the abolition of slavery a radical change of the relations of capital and of property in land is next upon the order of the day these are signs of the times not to be hidden by purple mantles or black cassocks they do not signify that tomorrow a miracle will happen they show that within the ruling classes themselves a foreboding is dawning that the present society is no solid crystal but an organism capable of change and is constantly changing the second volume of this book will treat of the process of the circulation of capital book ii and of the varied forms assumed by capital in the course of its development book iii the third and last volume book iv the history of the theory every opinion based on scientific criticism i welcome as to prejudices of socalled public opinion to which i have never made concessions now as aforetime the maxim of the great florentine is mine “segui il tuo corso e lascia dir le genti” follow your own course and let people talk – paraphrased from dante karl marx london july preface to the french edition marx to the citizen maurice lachâtre dear citizen i applaud your idea of publishing the translation of “das kapital” as a serial in this form the book will be more accessible to the working class a consideration which to me outweighs everything else that is the good side of your suggestion but here is the reverse of the medal the method of analysis which i have employed and which had not previously been applied to economic subjects makes the reading of the first chapters rather arduous and it is to be feared that the french public always impatient to come to a conclusion eager to know the connexion between general principles and the immediate questions that have aroused their passions may be disheartened because they will be unable to move on at once that is a disadvantage i am powerless to overcome unless it be by forewarning and forearming those readers who zealously seek the truth there is no royal road to science and only those who do not dread the fatiguing climb of its steep paths have a chance of gaining its luminous summits believe me dear citizen your devoted karl marx london march afterword to the second german edition i must start by informing the readers of the first edition about the alterations made in the second edition one is struck at once by the clearer arrangement of the book additional notes are everywhere marked as notes to the second edition the following are the most important points with regard to the text itself in chapter i section the derivation of value from an analysis of the equations by which every exchangevalue is expressed has been carried out with greater scientific strictness likewise the connexion between the substance of value and the determination of the magnitude of value by socially necessary labourtime which was only alluded to in the first edition is now expressly emphasised chapter i section the form of value has been completely revised a task which was made necessary by the double exposition in the first edition if nothing else – let me remark in passing that that double exposition had been occasioned by my friend dr l kugelmann in hanover i was visiting him in the spring of when the first proofsheets arrived from hamburg and he convinced me that most readers needed a supplementary more didactic explanation of the form of value – the last section of the first chapter “the fetishism of commodities etc” has largely been altered chapter iii section i the measure of value has been carefully revised because in the first edition this section had been treated negligently the reader having been referred to the explanation already given in “zur kritik der politischen oekonomie” berlin chapter vii particularly part eng ed chapter ix section has been rewritten to a great extent it would be a waste of time to go into all the partial textual changes which were often purely stylistic they occur throughout the book nevertheless i find now on revising the french translation appearing in paris that several parts of the german original stand in need of rather thorough remoulding other parts require rather heavy stylistic editing and still others painstaking elimination of occasional slips but there was no time for that for i had been informed only in the autumn of when in the midst of other urgent work that the book was sold out and that the printing of the second edition was to begin in january of the appreciation which “das kapital” rapidly gained in wide circles of the german working class is the best reward of my labours herr mayer a vienna manufacturer who in economic matters represents the bourgeois point of view in a pamphlet published during the francogerman war aptly expounded the idea that the great capacity for theory which used to be considered a hereditary german possession had almost completely disappeared amongst the socalled educated classes in germany but that amongst its working class on the contrary that capacity was celebrating its revival to the present moment political economy in germany is a foreign science gustav von gulich in his “historical description of commerce industry” c especially in the two first volumes published in has examined at length the historical circumstances that prevented in germany the development of the capitalist mode of production and consequently the development in that country of modern bourgeois society thus the soil whence political economy springs was wanting this “science” had to be imported from england and france as a readymade article its german professors remained schoolboys the theoretical expression of a foreign reality was turned in their hands into a collection of dogmas interpreted by them in terms of the petty trading world around them and therefore misinterpreted the feeling of scientific impotence a feeling not wholly to be repressed and the uneasy consciousness of having to touch a subject in reality foreign to them was but imperfectly concealed either under a parade of literary and historical erudition or by an admixture of extraneous material borrowed from the socalled “kameral” sciences a medley of smatterings through whose purgatory the hopeful candidate for the german bureaucracy has to pass since capitalist production has developed rapidly in germany and at the present time it is in the full bloom of speculation and swindling but fate is still unpropitious to our professional economists at the time when they were able to deal with political economy in a straightforward fashion modern economic conditions did not actually exist in germany and as soon as these conditions did come into existence they did so under circumstances that no longer allowed of their being really and impartially investigated within the bounds of the bourgeois horizon in so far as political economy remains within that horizon in so far ie as the capitalist regime is looked upon as the absolutely final form of social production instead of as a passing historical phase of its evolution political economy can remain a science only so long as the class struggle is latent or manifests itself only in isolated and sporadic phenomena let us take england its political economy belongs to the period in which the class struggle was as yet undeveloped its last great representative ricardo in the end consciously makes the antagonism of class interests of wages and profits of profits and rent the starting point of his investigations naively taking this antagonism for a social law of nature but by this start the science of bourgeois economy had reached the limits beyond which it could not pass already in the lifetime of ricardo and in opposition to him it was met by criticism in the person of sismondi the succeeding period from to was notable in england for scientific activity in the domain of political economy it was the time as well of the vulgarising and extending of ricardo’s theory as of the contest of that theory with the old school splendid tournaments were held what was done then is little known to the continent generally because the polemic is for the most part scattered through articles in reviews occasional literature and pamphlets the unprejudiced character of this polemic – although the theory of ricardo already serves in exceptional cases as a weapon of attack upon bourgeois economy – is explained by the circumstances of the time on the one hand modern industry itself was only just emerging from the age of childhood as is shown by the fact that with the crisis of it for the first time opens the periodic cycle of its modern life on the other hand the class struggle between capital and labour is forced into the background politically by the discord between the governments and the feudal aristocracy gathered around the holy alliance on the one hand and the popular masses led by the bourgeoisie on the other economically by the quarrel between industrial capital and aristocratic landed property a quarrel that in france was concealed by the opposition between small and large landed property and that in england broke out openly after the corn laws the literature of political economy in england at this time calls to mind the stormy forward movement in france after dr quesnay’s death but only as a saint martin’s summer reminds us of spring with the year came the decisive crisis in france and in england the bourgeoisie had conquered political power thenceforth the class struggle practically as well as theoretically took on more and more outspoken and threatening forms it sounded the knell of scientific bourgeois economy it was thenceforth no longer a question whether this theorem or that was true but whether it was useful to capital or harmful expedient or inexpedient politically dangerous or not in place of disinterested inquirers there were hired prize fighters in place of genuine scientific research the bad conscience and the evil intent of apologetic still even the obtrusive pamphlets with which the anticorn law league led by the manufacturers cobden and bright deluged the world have a historic interest if no scientific one on account of their polemic against the landed aristocracy but since then the free trade legislation inaugurated by sir robert peel has deprived vulgar economy of this its last sting the continental revolution of also had its reaction in england men who still claimed some scientific standing and aspired to be something more than mere sophists and sycophants of the ruling classes tried to harmonise the political economy of capital with the claims no longer to be ignored of the proletariat hence a shallow syncretism of which john stuart mill is the best representative it is a declaration of bankruptcy by bourgeois economy an event on which the great russian scholar and critic n tschernyschewsky has thrown the light of a master mind in his “outlines of political economy according to mill” in germany therefore the capitalist mode of production came to a head after its antagonistic character had already in france and england shown itself in a fierce strife of classes and meanwhile moreover the german proletariat had attained a much more clear classconsciousness than the german bourgeoisie thus at the very moment when a bourgeois science of political economy seemed at last possible in germany it had in reality again become impossible under these circumstances its professors fell into two groups the one set prudent practical business folk flocked to the banner of bastiat the most superficial and therefore the most adequate representative of the apologetic of vulgar economy the other proud of the professorial dignity of their science followed john stuart mill in his attempt to reconcile irreconcilables just as in the classical time of bourgeois economy so also in the time of its decline the germans remained mere schoolboys imitators and followers petty retailers and hawkers in the service of the great foreign wholesale concern the peculiar historical development of german society therefore forbids in that country all original work in bourgeois economy but not the criticism of that economy so far as such criticism represents a class it can only represent the class whose vocation in history is the overthrow of the capitalist mode of production and the final abolition of all classes – the proletariat the learned and unlearned spokesmen of the german bourgeoisie tried at first to kill “das kapital” by silence as they had managed to do with my earlier writings as soon as they found that these tactics no longer fitted in with the conditions of the time they wrote under pretence of criticising my book prescriptions “for the tranquillisation of the bourgeois mind” but they found in the workers’ press – see eg joseph dietzgen’s articles in the – antagonists stronger than themselves to whom down to this very day they owe a reply an excellent russian translation of “das kapital” appeared in the spring of the edition of copies is already nearly exhausted as early as n sieber professor of political economy in the university of kiev in his work “david ricardo’s theory of value and of capital” referred to my theory of value of money and of capital as in its fundamentals a necessary sequel to the teaching of smith and ricardo that which astonishes the western european in the reading of this excellent work is the author’s consistent and firm grasp of the purely theoretical position that the method employed in “das kapital” has been little understood is shown by the various conceptions contradictory one to another that have been formed of it thus the paris revue positiviste reproaches me in that on the one hand i treat economics metaphysically and on the other hand – imagine – confine myself to the mere critical analysis of actual facts instead of writing receipts comtist ones for the cookshops of the future in answer to the reproach in re metaphysics professor sieber has it “in so far as it deals with actual theory the method of marx is the deductive method of the whole english school a school whose failings and virtues are common to the best theoretic economists” m block – “les théoriciens du socialisme en allemagne extrait du journal des economistes juillet et août ” – makes the discovery that my method is analytic and says “par cet ouvrage m marx se classe parmi les esprits analytiques les plus eminents” german reviews of course shriek out at “hegelian sophistics” the european messenger of st petersburg in an article dealing exclusively with the method of “das kapital” may number pp finds my method of inquiry severely realistic but my method of presentation unfortunately germandialectical it says “at first sight if the judgment is based on the external form of the presentation of the subject marx is the most ideal of ideal philosophers always in the german ie the bad sense of the word but in point of fact he is infinitely more realistic than all his forerunners in the work of economic criticism he can in no sense be called an idealist” i cannot answer the writer better than by aid of a few extracts from his own criticism which may interest some of my readers to whom the russian original is inaccessible after a quotation from the preface to my “criticism of political economy” berlin pp ivvii where i discuss the materialistic basis of my method the writer goes on “the one thing which is of moment to marx is to find the law of the phenomena with whose investigation he is concerned and not only is that law of moment to him which governs these phenomena in so far as they have a definite form and mutual connexion within a given historical period of still greater moment to him is the law of their variation of their development ie of their transition from one form into another from one series of connexions into a different one this law once discovered he investigates in detail the effects in which it manifests itself in social life consequently marx only troubles himself about one thing to show by rigid scientific investigation the necessity of successive determinate orders of social conditions and to establish as impartially as possible the facts that serve him for fundamental startingpoints for this it is quite enough if he proves at the same time both the necessity of the present order of things and the necessity of another order into which the first must inevitably pass over and this all the same whether men believe or do not believe it whether they are conscious or unconscious of it marx treats the social movement as a process of natural history governed by laws not only independent of human will consciousness and intelligence but rather on the contrary determining that will consciousness and intelligence if in the history of civilisation the conscious element plays a part so subordinate then it is selfevident that a critical inquiry whose subjectmatter is civilisation can less than anything else have for its basis any form of or any result of consciousness that is to say that not the idea but the material phenomenon alone can serve as its startingpoint such an inquiry will confine itself to the confrontation and the comparison of a fact not with ideas but with another fact for this inquiry the one thing of moment is that both facts be investigated as accurately as possible and that they actually form each with respect to the other different momenta of an evolution but most important of all is the rigid analysis of the series of successions of the sequences and concatenations in which the different stages of such an evolution present themselves but it will be said the general laws of economic life are one and the same no matter whether they are applied to the present or the past this marx directly denies according to him such abstract laws do not exist on the contrary in his opinion every historical period has laws of its own as soon as society has outlived a given period of development and is passing over from one given stage to another it begins to be subject also to other laws in a word economic life offers us a phenomenon analogous to the history of evolution in other branches of biology the old economists misunderstood the nature of economic laws when they likened them to the laws of physics and chemistry a more thorough analysis of phenomena shows that social organisms differ among themselves as fundamentally as plants or animals nay one and the same phenomenon falls under quite different laws in consequence of the different structure of those organisms as a whole of the variations of their individual organs of the different conditions in which those organs function c marx eg denies that the law of population is the same at all times and in all places he asserts on the contrary that every stage of development has its own law of population with the varying degree of development of productive power social conditions and the laws governing them vary too whilst marx sets himself the task of following and explaining from this point of view the economic system established by the sway of capital he is only formulating in a strictly scientific manner the aim that every accurate investigation into economic life must have the scientific value of such an inquiry lies in the disclosing of the special laws that regulate the origin existence development death of a given social organism and its replacement by another and higher one and it is this value that in point of fact marx’s book has” whilst the writer pictures what he takes to be actually my method in this striking and as far as concerns my own application of it generous way what else is he picturing but the dialectic method of course the method of presentation must differ in form from that of inquiry the latter has to appropriate the material in detail to analyse its different forms of development to trace out their inner connexion only after this work is done can the actual movement be adequately described if this is done successfully if the life of the subjectmatter is ideally reflected as in a mirror then it may appear as if we had before us a mere a priori construction my dialectic method is not only different from the hegelian but is its direct opposite to hegel the life process of the human brain ie the process of thinking which under the name of “the idea” he even transforms into an independent subject is the demiurgos of the real world and the real world is only the external phenomenal form of “the idea” with me on the contrary the ideal is nothing else than the material world reflected by the human mind and translated into forms of thought the mystifying side of hegelian dialectic i criticised nearly thirty years ago at a time when it was still the fashion but just as i was working at the first volume of “das kapital” it was the good pleasure of the peevish arrogant mediocre epigonoi epigones – büchner dühring and others who now talk large in cultured germany to treat hegel in same way as the brave moses mendelssohn in lessing’s time treated spinoza ie as a “dead dog” i therefore openly avowed myself the pupil of that mighty thinker and even here and there in the chapter on the theory of value coquetted with the modes of expression peculiar to him the mystification which dialectic suffers in hegel’s hands by no means prevents him from being the first to present its general form of working in a comprehensive and conscious manner with him it is standing on its head it must be turned right side up again if you would discover the rational kernel within the mystical shell in its mystified form dialectic became the fashion in germany because it seemed to transfigure and to glorify the existing state of things in its rational form it is a scandal and abomination to bourgeoisdom and its doctrinaire professors because it includes in its comprehension and affirmative recognition of the existing state of things at the same time also the recognition of the negation of that state of its inevitable breaking up because it regards every historically developed social form as in fluid movement and therefore takes into account its transient nature not less than its momentary existence because it lets nothing impose upon it and is in its essence critical and revolutionary the contradictions inherent in the movement of capitalist society impress themselves upon the practical bourgeois most strikingly in the changes of the periodic cycle through which modern industry runs and whose crowning point is the universal crisis that crisis is once again approaching although as yet but in its preliminary stage and by the universality of its theatre and the intensity of its action it will drum dialectics even into the heads of the mushroomupstarts of the new holy prussogerman empire karl marx london january afterword to the french edition mr j roy set himself the task of producing a version that would be as exact and even literal as possible and has scrupulously fulfilled it but his very scrupulosity has compelled me to modify his text with a view to rendering it more intelligible to the reader these alterations introduced from day to day as the book was published in parts were not made with equal care and were bound to result in a lack of harmony in style having once undertaken this work of revision i was led to apply it also to the basic original text the second german edition to simplify some arguments to complete others to give additional historical or statistical material to add critical suggestions etc hence whatever the literary defects of this french edition may be it possesses a scientific value independent of the original and should be consulted even by readers familiar with german below i give the passages in the afterword to the second german edition which treat of the development of political economy in germany and the method employed in the present work karl marx london april preface to the third german edition marx was not destined to get this the third edition ready for press himself the powerful thinker to whose greatness even his opponents now make obeisance died on march upon me who in marx lost the best the truest friend i had – and had for forty years – the friend to whom i am more indebted than can be expressed in words – upon me now devolved the duty of attending to the publication of this third edition as well as of the second volume which marx had left behind in manuscript i must now account here to the reader for the way in which i discharged the first part of my duty it was marxs original intention to rewrite a great part of the text of volume i to formulate many theoretical points more exactly insert new ones and bring historical and statistical materials up to date but his ailing condition and the urgent need to do the final editing of volume ii induced him to give up this scheme only the most necessary alterations were to be made only the insertions which the french edition “le capital” par karl marx paris lachâtre already contained were to be put in among the books left by marx there was a german copy which he himself had corrected here and there and provided with references to the french edition also a french copy in which he had indicated the exact passages to be used these alterations and additions are confined with few exceptions to the last engl ed second last part of the book “the accumulation of capital” here the previous text followed the original draft more closely than elsewhere while the preceding sections had been gone over more thoroughly the style was therefore more vivacious more of a single cast but also more careless studded with anglicisms and in parts unclear there were gaps here and there in the presentation of arguments some important particulars being merely alluded to with regard to the style marx had himself thoroughly revised several subsections and thereby had indicated to me here as well as in numerous oral suggestions the length to which i could go in eliminating english technical terms and other anglicisms marx would in any event have gone over the additions and supplemental texts and have replaced the smooth french with his own terse german i had to be satisfied when transferring them with bringing them into maximum harmony with the original text thus not a single word was changed in this third edition without my firm conviction that the author would have altered it himself it would never occur to me to introduce into “das kapital” the current jargon in which german economists are wont to express themselves – that gibberish in which for instance one who for cash has others give him their labour is called a labourgiver arbeitgeber and one whose labour is taken away from him for wages is called a labourtaker arbeitnehmer in french too the word “travail” is used in everyday life in the sense of “occupation” but the french would rightly consider any economist crazy should he call the capitalist a donneur de travail a labourgiver or the worker a receveur de travail a labourtaker nor have i taken the liberty to convert the english coins and moneys measures and weights used throughout the text to their newgerman equivalents when the first edition appeared there were as many kinds of measures and weights in germany as there are days in the year besides there were two kinds of marks the reichsmark existed at the time only in the imagination of soetbeer who had invented it in the late thirties two kinds of gulden and at least three kinds of taler including one called neues zweidrittel in the natural sciences the metric system prevailed in the world market – english measures and weights under such circumstances english units of measure were quite natural for a book which had to take its factual proofs almost exclusively from british industrial relations the lastnamed reason is decisive even today especially because the corresponding relations in the world market have hardly changed and english weights and measures almost completely control precisely the key industries iron and cotton in conclusion a few words on marxs art of quotation which is so little understood when they are pure statements of fact or descriptions the quotations from the english blue books for example serve of course as simple documentary proof but this is not so when the theoretical views of other economists are cited here the quotation is intended merely to state where when and by whom an economic idea conceived in the course of development was first clearly enunciated here the only consideration is that the economic conception in question must be of some significance to the history of science that it is the more or less adequate theoretical expression of the economic situation of its time but whether this conception still possesses any absolute or relative validity from the standpoint of the author or whether it already has become wholly past history is quite immaterial hence these quotations are only a running commentary to the text a commentary borrowed from the history of economic science and establish the dates and originators of certain of the more important advances in economic theory and that was a very necessary thing in a science whose historians have so far distinguished themselves only by tendentious ignorance characteristic of careerists it will now be understandable why marx in consonance with the afterword to the second edition only in very exceptional cases had occasion to quote german economists there is hope that the second volume will appear in the course of frederick engels london november preface to the english edition engels the publication of an english version of “das kapital” needs no apology on the contrary an explanation might be expected why this english version has been delayed until now seeing that for some years past the theories advocated in this book have been constantly referred to attacked and defended interpreted and misinterpreted in the periodical press and the current literature of both england and america when soon after the authors death in it became evident that an english edition of the work was really required mr samuel moore for many years a friend of marx and of the present writer and than whom perhaps no one is more conversant with the book itself consented to undertake the translation which the literary executors of marx were anxious to lay before the public it was understood that i should compare the ms with the original work and suggest such alterations as i might deem advisable when by and by it was found that mr moores professional occupations prevented him from finishing the translation as quickly as we all desired we gladly accepted dr avelings offer to undertake a portion of the work at the same time mrs aveling marxs youngest daughter offered to check the quotations and to restore the original text of the numerous passages taken from english authors and blue books and translated by marx into german this has been done throughout with but a few unavoidable exceptions the following portions of the book have been translated by dr aveling i chapters x the working day and xi rate and mass of surplusvalue part vi wages comprising chapters xix to xxii from chapter xxiv section circumstances that c to the end of the book comprising the latter part of chapter xxiv chapter xxv and the whole of part viii chapters xxvi to xxxiii the two authors prefaces all the rest of the book has been done by mr moore while thus each of the translators is responsible for his share of the work only i bear a joint responsibility for the whole the third german edition which has been made the basis of our work throughout was prepared by me in with the assistance of notes left by the author indicating the passages of the second edition to be replaced by designated passages from the french text published in the alterations thus effected in the text of the second edition generally coincided with changes prescribed by marx in a set of ms instructions for an english translation that was planned about ten years ago in america but abandoned chiefly for want of a fit and proper translator this ms was placed at our disposal by our old friend mr f a sorge of hoboken n j it designates some further interpolations from the french edition but being so many years older than the final instructions for the third edition i did not consider myself at liberty to make use of it otherwise than sparingly and chiefly in cases where it helped us over difficulties in the same way the french text has been referred to in most of the difficult passages as an indicator of what the author himself was prepared to sacrifice wherever something of the full import of the original had to be sacrificed in the rendering there is however one difficulty we could not spare the reader the use of certain terms in a sense different from what they have not only in common life but in ordinary political economy but this was unavoidable every new aspect of a science involves a revolution in the technical terms of that science this is best shown by chemistry where the whole of the terminology is radically changed about once in twenty years and where you will hardly find a single organic compound that has not gone through a whole series of different names political economy has generally been content to take just as they were the terms of commercial and industrial life and to operate with them entirely failing to see that by so doing it confined itself within the narrow circle of ideas expressed by those terms thus though perfectly aware that both profits and rent are but subdivisions fragments of that unpaid part of the product which the labourer has to supply to his employer its first appropriator though not its ultimate exclusive owner yet even classical political economy never went beyond the received notions of profits and rents never examined this unpaid part of the product called by marx surplusproduct in its integrity as a whole and therefore never arrived at a clear comprehension either of its origin and nature or of the laws that regulate the subsequent distribution of its value similarly all industry not agricultural or handicraft is indiscriminately comprised in the term of manufacture and thereby the distinction is obliterated between two great and essentially different periods of economic history the period of manufacture proper based on the division of manual labour and the period of modern industry based on machinery it is however self evident that a theory which views modern capitalist production as a mere passing stage in the economic history of mankind must make use of terms different from those habitual to writers who look upon that form of production as imperishable and final a word respecting the authors method of quoting may not be out of place in the majority of cases the quotations serve in the usual way as documentary evidence in support of assertions made in the text but in many instances passages from economic writers are quoted in order to indicate when where and by whom a certain proposition was for the first time clearly enunciated this is done in cases where the proposition quoted is of importance as being a more or less adequate expression of the conditions of social production and exchange prevalent at the time and quite irrespective of marxs recognition or otherwise of its general validity these quotations therefore supplement the text by a running commentary taken from the history of the science our translation comprises the first book of the work only but this first book is in a great measure a whole in itself and has for twenty years ranked as an independent work the second book edited in german by me in is decidedly incomplete without the third which cannot be published before the end of when book iii has been brought out in the original german it will then be soon enough to think about preparing an english edition of both “das kapital” is often called on the continent “the bible of the working class” that the conclusions arrived at in this work are daily more and more becoming the fundamental principles of the great working class movement not only in germany and switzerland but in france in holland and belgium in america and even in italy and spain that everywhere the working class more and more recognises in these conclusions the most adequate expression of its condition and of its aspirations nobody acquainted with that movement will deny and in england too the theories of marx even at this moment exercise a powerful influence upon the socialist movement which is spreading in the ranks of “cultured” people no less than in those of the working class but that is not all the time is rapidly approaching when a thorough examination of englands economic position will impose itself as an irresistible national necessity the working of the industrial system of this country impossible without a constant and rapid extension of production and therefore of markets is coming to a dead stop free trade has exhausted its resources even manchester doubts this its quondam economic gospel foreign industry rapidly developing stares english production in the face everywhere not only in protected but also in neutral markets and even on this side of the channel while the productive power increases in a geometric the extension of markets proceeds at best in an arithmetic ratio the decennial cycle of stagnation prosperity overproduction and crisis ever recurrent from to seems indeed to have run its course but only to land us in the slough of despond of a permanent and chronic depression the sighed for period of prosperity will not come as often as we seem to perceive its heralding symptoms so often do they again vanish into air meanwhile each succeeding winter brings up afresh the great question “what to do with the unemployed but while the number of the unemployed keeps swelling from year to year there is nobody to answer that question and we can almost calculate the moment when the unemployed losing patience will take their own fate into their own hands surely at such a moment the voice ought to be heard of a man whose whole theory is the result of a lifelong study of the economic history and condition of england and whom that study led to the conclusion that at least in europe england is the only country where the inevitable social revolution might be effected entirely by peaceful and legal means he certainly never forgot to add that he hardly expected the english ruling classes to submit without a “proslavery rebellion” to this peaceful and legal revolution preface to the fourth german edition engels the fourth edition required that i should establish in final form as nearly as possible both text and footnotes the following brief explanation will show how i have fulfilled this task after again comparing the french edition and marx’s manuscript remarks i have made some further additions to the german text from that translation they will be found on p rd edition p present edition pp pp rd edition pp present edition pp pp rd edition p present edition pp pp rd edition p present edition and p rd edition p present edition p in note i have also followed the example of the french and english editions by putting the long footnote on the miners into the text rd edition pp th edition pp present edition pp other small alterations are of a purely technical nature further i have added a few more explanatory notes especially where changed historical conditions seemed to demand this all these additional notes are enclosed in square brackets and marked either with my initials or “d h” meanwhile a complete revision of the numerous quotations had been made necessary by the publication of the english edition for this edition marx’s youngest daughter eleanor undertook to compare all the quotations with their originals so that those taken from english sources which constitute the vast majority are given there not as retranslations from the german but in the original english form in preparing the fourth edition it was therefore incumbent upon me to consult this text the comparison revealed various small inaccuracies page numbers wrongly indicated due partly to mistakes in copying from notebooks and partly to the accumulated misprints of three editions misplaced quotation or omission marks which cannot be avoided when a mass of quotations is copied from notebook extracts here and there some rather unhappy translation of a word particular passages quoted from the old paris notebooks of when marx did not know english and was reading english economists in french translations so that the double translation yielded a slightly different shade of meaning eg in the case of steuart ure etc where the english text had now to be used – and other similar instances of trifling inaccuracy or negligence but anyone who compares the fourth edition with the previous ones can convince himself that all this laborious process of emendation has not produced the smallest change in the book worth speaking of there was only one quotation which could not be traced – the one from richard jones th edition p note marx probably slipped up when writing down the title of the book all the other quotations retain their cogency in full or have enhanced it due to their present exact form here however i am obliged to revert to an old story i know of only one case in which the accuracy of a quotation given by marx has been called in question but as the issue dragged beyond his lifetime i cannot well ignore it here on march there appeared in the berlin concordia organ of the german manufacturers’ association an anonymous article entitled “how karl marx quotes” it was here asserted with an effervescence of moral indignation and unparliamentary language that the quotation from gladstone’s budget speech of april in the inaugural address of the international workingmen’s association and repeated in “capital” vol i p th edition p rd edition present edition p had been falsified that not a single word of the sentence “this intoxicating augmentation of wealth and power is entirely confined to classes of property” was to be found in the semiofficial stenographic report in hansard “but this sentence is nowhere to be found in gladstone’s speech exactly the opposite is stated there” in bold type “this sentence both in form and substance is a lie inserted by marx marx to whom the number of concordia was sent the following may answered the anonymous author in the volksstaat of june st as he could not recall which newspaper report he had used for the quotation he limited himself to citing first the equivalent quotation from two english publications and then the report in the times according to which gladstone says “that is the state of the case as regards the wealth of this country i must say for one i should look almost with apprehension and with pain upon this intoxicating augmentation of wealth and power if it were my belief that it was confined to classes who are in easy circumstances this takes no cognisance at all of the condition of the labouring population the augmentation i have described and which is founded i think upon accurate returns is an augmentation entirely confined to classes possessed of property” thus gladstone says here that he would be sorry if it were so but it is so this intoxicating augmentation of wealth and power is entirely confined to classes of property and as to the semiofficial hansard marx goes on to say “in the version which he afterwards manipulated zurechtgestümpert mr gladstone was astute enough to obliterate wegzupfuschen this passage which coming from an english chancellor of the exchequer was certainly compromising this by the way is a traditional usage in the english parliament and not an invention gotten up by little lasker against bebel” the anonymous writer gets angrier and angrier in his answer in concordia july th he sweeps aside secondhand sources and demurely suggests that it is the “custom” to quote parliamentary speeches from the stenographic report adding however that the times report which includes the “falsified” sentence and the hansard report which omits it are “substantially in complete agreement” while the times report likewise contains “the exact opposite to that notorious passage in the inaugural address” this fellow carefully conceals the fact that the times report explicitly includes that selfsame “notorious passage” alongside of its alleged “opposite” despite all this however the anonymous one feels that he is stuck fast and that only some new dodge can save him thus whilst his article bristles as we have just shown with “impudent mendacity” and is interlarded with such edifying terms of abuse as “bad faith” “dishonesty” “lying allegation” “that spurious quotation” “impudent mendacity” “a quotation entirely falsified” “this falsification” “simply infamous” etc he finds it necessary to divert the issue to another domain and therefore promises “to explain in a second article the meaning which we the nonmendacious anonymous one attribute to the content of gladstone’s words” as if his particular opinion of no decisive value as it is had anything whatever to do with the matter this second article was printed in concordia on july th marx replied again in the volksstaat of august th now giving also the reports of the passage in question from the morning star and the morning advertiser of april according to both reports gladstone said that he would look with apprehension etc upon this intoxicating augmentation of wealth and power if he believed it to be confined to “classes in easy circumstances” but this augmentation was in fact “entirely confined to classes possessed of property” so these reports too reproduced word for word the sentence alleged to have been “lyingly inserted” marx further established once more by a comparison of the times and the hansard texts that this sentence which three newspaper reports of identical content appearing independently of one another the next morning proved to have been really uttered was missing from the hansard report revised according to the familiar “custom” and that gladstone to use marx’s words “had afterwards conjured it away” in conclusion marx stated that he had no time for further intercourse with the anonymous one the latter also seems to have had enough at any rate marx received no further issues of concordia with this the matter appeared to be dead and buried true once or twice later on there reached us from persons in touch with the university of cambridge mysterious rumours of an unspeakable literary crime which marx was supposed to have committed in “capital” but despite all investigation nothing more definite could be learned then on november eight months after marx’s death there appeared in the times a letter headed trinity college cambridge and signed sedley taylor in which this little man who dabbles in the mildest sort of cooperative affairs seizing upon some chance pretext or other at last enlightened us not only concerning those vague cambridge rumours but also the anonymous one in concordia “what appears extremely singular” says the little man from trinity college “is that it was reserved for professor brentano then of the university of breslau now of that of strassburg to expose the bad faith which had manifestly dictated the citation made from mr gladstone’s speech in the inaugural address herr karl marx who attempted to defend the citation had the hardihood in the deadly shifts to which brentano’s masterly conduct of the attack speedily reduced him to assert that mr gladstone had ‘manipulated’ the report of his speech in the times of april before it appeared in hansard in order to ‘obliterate’ a passage which ‘was certainly compromising’ for an english chancellor of the exchequer on brentano’s showing by a detailed comparison of texts that the reports of the times and of hansard agreed in utterly excluding the meaning which craftily isolated quotation had put upon mr gladstone’s words marx withdrew from further controversy under the plea of ‘want of time’” so that was at the bottom of the whole business and thus was the anonymous campaign of herr brentano in concordia gloriously reflected in the productively cooperating imagination of cambridge thus he stood sword in hand and thus he battled in his “masterly conduct of the attack” this st george of the german manufacturers’ association whilst the infernal dragon marx “in deadly shifts” “speedily” breathed his last at his feet all this ariostian battle scene however only serves to conceal the dodges of our st george here there is no longer talk of “lying insertion” or “falsification” but of “craftily isolated quotation” the whole issue was shifted and st george and his cambridge squire very well knew why eleanor marx replied in the monthly journal today february as the times refused to publish her letter she once more focussed the debate on the sole question at issue had marx “lyingly inserted” that sentence or not to this mr sedley taylor answered that “the question whether a particular sentence did or did not occur in mr gladstone’s speech” had been in his opinion “of very subordinate importance” in the brentanomarx controversy “compared to the issue whether the quotation in dispute was made with the intention of conveying or of perverting mr gladstone’s meaning” he then admits that the times report contains “a verbal contrariety but if the context is rightly interpreted ie in the gladstonian liberal sense it shows what mr gladstone meant to say today march the most comic point here is that our little cambridge man now insists upon quoting the speech not from hansard as according to the anonymous brentano it is “customary” to do but from the times report which the same brentano had characterised as “necessarily bungling” naturally so for in hansard the vexatious sentence is missing eleanor marx had no difficulty in the same issue of today in dissolving all this argumentation into thin air either mr taylor had read the controversy of in which case he was now making not only “lying insertions” but also “lying” suppressions or he had not read it and ought to remain silent in either case it was certain that he did not dare to maintain for a moment the accusation of his friend brentano that marx had made a “lying” addition on the contrary marx it now seems had not lyingly added but suppressed an important sentence but this same sentence is quoted on page of the inaugural address a few lines before the alleged “lying insertion” and as to the “contrariety” in gladstone’s speech is it not marx himself who in “capital” p rd edition p note present edition p note refers to “the continual crying contradictions in gladstone’s budget speeches of and only he does not presume à la mr sedley taylor to resolve them into complacent liberal sentiments eleanor marx in concluding her reply finally sums up as follows “marx has not suppressed anything worth quoting neither has he ‘lyingly’ added anything but he has restored rescued from oblivion a particular sentence of one of mr gladstone’s speeches a sentence which had indubitably been pronounced but which somehow or other had found its way – out of hansard” with that mr sedley taylor too had had enough and the result of this whole professorial cobweb spun out over two decades and two great countries is that nobody has since dared to cast any other aspersion upon marx’s literary honesty whilst mr sedley taylor no doubt will hereafter put as little confidence in the literary war bulletins of herr brentano as herr brentano will in the papal infallibility of hansard frederick engels london june part commodities and money chapter commodities section the two factors of a commodity usevalue and value the substance of value and the magnitude of value the wealth of those societies in which the capitalist mode of production prevails presents itself as “an immense accumulation of commodities” its unit being a single commodity our investigation must therefore begin with the analysis of a commodity a commodity is in the first place an object outside us a thing that by its properties satisfies human wants of some sort or another the nature of such wants whether for instance they spring from the stomach or from fancy makes no difference neither are we here concerned to know how the object satisfies these wants whether directly as means of subsistence or indirectly as means of production every useful thing as iron paper c may be looked at from the two points of view of quality and quantity it is an assemblage of many properties and may therefore be of use in various ways to discover the various uses of things is the work of history so also is the establishment of sociallyrecognized standards of measure for the quantities of these useful objects the diversity of these measures has its origin partly in the diverse nature of the objects to be measured partly in convention the utility of a thing makes it a use value but this utility is not a thing of air being limited by the physical properties of the commodity it has no existence apart from that commodity a commodity such as iron corn or a diamond is therefore so far as it is a material thing a use value something useful this property of a commodity is independent of the amount of labour required to appropriate its useful qualities when treating of use value we always assume to be dealing with definite quantities such as dozens of watches yards of linen or tons of iron the use values of commodities furnish the material for a special study that of the commercial knowledge of commodities use values become a reality only by use or consumption they also constitute the substance of all wealth whatever may be the social form of that wealth in the form of society we are about to consider they are in addition the material depositories of exchange value exchange value at first sight presents itself as a quantitative relation as the proportion in which values in use of one sort are exchanged for those of another sort a relation constantly changing with time and place hence exchange value appears to be something accidental and purely relative and consequently an intrinsic value ie an exchange value that is inseparably connected with inherent in commodities seems a contradiction in terms let us consider the matter a little more closely a given commodity eg a quarter of wheat is exchanged for x blacking y silk or z gold c – in short for other commodities in the most different proportions instead of one exchange value the wheat has therefore a great many but since x blacking y silk or z gold c each represents the exchange value of one quarter of wheat x blacking y silk z gold c must as exchange values be replaceable by each other or equal to each other therefore first the valid exchange values of a given commodity express something equal secondly exchange value generally is only the mode of expression the phenomenal form of something contained in it yet distinguishable from it let us take two commodities eg corn and iron the proportions in which they are exchangeable whatever those proportions may be can always be represented by an equation in which a given quantity of corn is equated to some quantity of iron eg quarter corn x cwt iron what does this equation tell us it tells us that in two different things – in quarter of corn and x cwt of iron there exists in equal quantities something common to both the two things must therefore be equal to a third which in itself is neither the one nor the other each of them so far as it is exchange value must therefore be reducible to this third a simple geometrical illustration will make this clear in order to calculate and compare the areas of rectilinear figures we decompose them into triangles but the area of the triangle itself is expressed by something totally different from its visible figure namely by half the product of the base multiplied by the altitude in the same way the exchange values of commodities must be capable of being expressed in terms of something common to them all of which thing they represent a greater or less quantity this common “something” cannot be either a geometrical a chemical or any other natural property of commodities such properties claim our attention only in so far as they affect the utility of those commodities make them use values but the exchange of commodities is evidently an act characterised by a total abstraction from use value then one use value is just as good as another provided only it be present in sufficient quantity or as old barbon says “one sort of wares are as good as another if the values be equal there is no difference or distinction in things of equal value an hundred pounds’ worth of lead or iron is of as great value as one hundred pounds’ worth of silver or gold” as use values commodities are above all of different qualities but as exchange values they are merely different quantities and consequently do not contain an atom of use value if then we leave out of consideration the use value of commodities they have only one common property left that of being products of labour but even the product of labour itself has undergone a change in our hands if we make abstraction from its use value we make abstraction at the same time from the material elements and shapes that make the product a use value we see in it no longer a table a house yarn or any other useful thing its existence as a material thing is put out of sight neither can it any longer be regarded as the product of the labour of the joiner the mason the spinner or of any other definite kind of productive labour along with the useful qualities of the products themselves we put out of sight both the useful character of the various kinds of labour embodied in them and the concrete forms of that labour there is nothing left but what is common to them all all are reduced to one and the same sort of labour human labour in the abstract let us now consider the residue of each of these products it consists of the same unsubstantial reality in each a mere congelation of homogeneous human labour of labour power expended without regard to the mode of its expenditure all that these things now tell us is that human labour power has been expended in their production that human labour is embodied in them when looked at as crystals of this social substance common to them all they are – values we have seen that when commodities are exchanged their exchange value manifests itself as something totally independent of their use value but if we abstract from their use value there remains their value as defined above therefore the common substance that manifests itself in the exchange value of commodities whenever they are exchanged is their value the progress of our investigation will show that exchange value is the only form in which the value of commodities can manifest itself or be expressed for the present however we have to consider the nature of value independently of this its form a use value or useful article therefore has value only because human labour in the abstract has been embodied or materialised in it how then is the magnitude of this value to be measured plainly by the quantity of the valuecreating substance the labour contained in the article the quantity of labour however is measured by its duration and labour time in its turn finds its standard in weeks days and hours some people might think that if the value of a commodity is determined by the quantity of labour spent on it the more idle and unskilful the labourer the more valuable would his commodity be because more time would be required in its production the labour however that forms the substance of value is homogeneous human labour expenditure of one uniform labour power the total labour power of society which is embodied in the sum total of the values of all commodities produced by that society counts here as one homogeneous mass of human labour power composed though it be of innumerable individual units each of these units is the same as any other so far as it has the character of the average labour power of society and takes effect as such that is so far as it requires for producing a commodity no more time than is needed on an average no more than is socially necessary the labour time socially necessary is that required to produce an article under the normal conditions of production and with the average degree of skill and intensity prevalent at the time the introduction of powerlooms into england probably reduced by onehalf the labour required to weave a given quantity of yarn into cloth the handloom weavers as a matter of fact continued to require the same time as before but for all that the product of one hour of their labour represented after the change only half an hour’s social labour and consequently fell to onehalf its former value we see then that that which determines the magnitude of the value of any article is the amount of labour socially necessary or the labour time socially necessary for its production each individual commodity in this connexion is to be considered as an average sample of its class commodities therefore in which equal quantities of labour are embodied or which can be produced in the same time have the same value the value of one commodity is to the value of any other as the labour time necessary for the production of the one is to that necessary for the production of the other “as values all commodities are only definite masses of congealed labour time” the value of a commodity would therefore remain constant if the labour time required for its production also remained constant but the latter changes with every variation in the productiveness of labour this productiveness is determined by various circumstances amongst others by the average amount of skill of the workmen the state of science and the degree of its practical application the social organisation of production the extent and capabilities of the means of production and by physical conditions for example the same amount of labour in favourable seasons is embodied in bushels of corn and in unfavourable only in four the same labour extracts from rich mines more metal than from poor mines diamonds are of very rare occurrence on the earth’s surface and hence their discovery costs on an average a great deal of labour time consequently much labour is represented in a small compass jacob doubts whether gold has ever been paid for at its full value this applies still more to diamonds according to eschwege the total produce of the brazilian diamond mines for the eighty years ending in had not realised the price of oneandahalf years’ average produce of the sugar and coffee plantations of the same country although the diamonds cost much more labour and therefore represented more value with richer mines the same quantity of labour would embody itself in more diamonds and their value would fall if we could succeed at a small expenditure of labour in converting carbon into diamonds their value might fall below that of bricks in general the greater the productiveness of labour the less is the labour time required for the production of an article the less is the amount of labour crystallised in that article and the less is its value and vice versâ the less the productiveness of labour the greater is the labour time required for the production of an article and the greater is its value the value of a commodity therefore varies directly as the quantity and inversely as the productiveness of the labour incorporated in it a thing can be a use value without having value this is the case whenever its utility to man is not due to labour such are air virgin soil natural meadows c a thing can be useful and the product of human labour without being a commodity whoever directly satisfies his wants with the produce of his own labour creates indeed use values but not commodities in order to produce the latter he must not only produce use values but use values for others social use values and not only for others without more the mediaeval peasant produced quitrentcorn for his feudal lord and tithecorn for his parson but neither the quitrentcorn nor the tithecorn became commodities by reason of the fact that they had been produced for others to become a commodity a product must be transferred to another whom it will serve as a use value by means of an exchange lastly nothing can have value without being an object of utility if the thing is useless so is the labour contained in it the labour does not count as labour and therefore creates no value section the twofold character of the labour embodied in commodities at first sight a commodity presented itself to us as a complex of two things – use value and exchange value later on we saw also that labour too possesses the same twofold nature for so far as it finds expression in value it does not possess the same characteristics that belong to it as a creator of use values i was the first to point out and to examine critically this twofold nature of the labour contained in commodities as this point is the pivot on which a clear comprehension of political economy turns we must go more into detail let us take two commodities such as a coat and yards of linen and let the former be double the value of the latter so that if yards of linen w the coat w the coat is a use value that satisfies a particular want its existence is the result of a special sort of productive activity the nature of which is determined by its aim mode of operation subject means and result the labour whose utility is thus represented by the value in use of its product or which manifests itself by making its product a use value we call useful labour in this connection we consider only its useful effect as the coat and the linen are two qualitatively different use values so also are the two forms of labour that produce them tailoring and weaving were these two objects not qualitatively different not produced respectively by labour of different quality they could not stand to each other in the relation of commodities coats are not exchanged for coats one use value is not exchanged for another of the same kind to all the different varieties of values in use there correspond as many different kinds of useful labour classified according to the order genus species and variety to which they belong in the social division of labour this division of labour is a necessary condition for the production of commodities but it does not follow conversely that the production of commodities is a necessary condition for the division of labour in the primitive indian community there is social division of labour without production of commodities or to take an example nearer home in every factory the labour is divided according to a system but this division is not brought about by the operatives mutually exchanging their individual products only such products can become commodities with regard to each other as result from different kinds of labour each kind being carried on independently and for the account of private individuals to resume then in the use value of each commodity there is contained useful labour ie productive activity of a definite kind and exercised with a definite aim use values cannot confront each other as commodities unless the useful labour embodied in them is qualitatively different in each of them in a community the produce of which in general takes the form of commodities ie in a community of commodity producers this qualitative difference between the useful forms of labour that are carried on independently by individual producers each on their own account develops into a complex system a social division of labour anyhow whether the coat be worn by the tailor or by his customer in either case it operates as a use value nor is the relation between the coat and the labour that produced it altered by the circumstance that tailoring may have become a special trade an independent branch of the social division of labour wherever the want of clothing forced them to it the human race made clothes for thousands of years without a single man becoming a tailor but coats and linen like every other element of material wealth that is not the spontaneous produce of nature must invariably owe their existence to a special productive activity exercised with a definite aim an activity that appropriates particular naturegiven materials to particular human wants so far therefore as labour is a creator of use value is useful labour it is a necessary condition independent of all forms of society for the existence of the human race it is an eternal natureimposed necessity without which there can be no material exchanges between man and nature and therefore no life the use values coat linen c ie the bodies of commodities are combinations of two elements – matter and labour if we take away the useful labour expended upon them a material substratum is always left which is furnished by nature without the help of man the latter can work only as nature does that is by changing the form of matter nay more in this work of changing the form he is constantly helped by natural forces we see then that labour is not the only source of material wealth of use values produced by labour as william petty puts it labour is its father and the earth its mother let us now pass from the commodity considered as a use value to the value of commodities by our assumption the coat is worth twice as much as the linen but this is a mere quantitative difference which for the present does not concern us we bear in mind however that if the value of the coat is double that of yds of linen yds of linen must have the same value as one coat so far as they are values the coat and the linen are things of a like substance objective expressions of essentially identical labour but tailoring and weaving are qualitatively different kinds of labour there are however states of society in which one and the same man does tailoring and weaving alternately in which case these two forms of labour are mere modifications of the labour of the same individual and not special and fixed functions of different persons just as the coat which our tailor makes one day and the trousers which he makes another day imply only a variation in the labour of one and the same individual moreover we see at a glance that in our capitalist society a given portion of human labour is in accordance with the varying demand at one time supplied in the form of tailoring at another in the form of weaving this change may possibly not take place without friction but take place it must productive activity if we leave out of sight its special form viz the useful character of the labour is nothing but the expenditure of human labour power tailoring and weaving though qualitatively different productive activities are each a productive expenditure of human brains nerves and muscles and in this sense are human labour they are but two different modes of expending human labour power of course this labour power which remains the same under all its modifications must have attained a certain pitch of development before it can be expended in a multiplicity of modes but the value of a commodity represents human labour in the abstract the expenditure of human labour in general and just as in society a general or a banker plays a great part but mere man on the other hand a very shabby part so here with mere human labour it is the expenditure of simple labour power ie of the labour power which on an average apart from any special development exists in the organism of every ordinary individual simple average labour it is true varies in character in different countries and at different times but in a particular society it is given skilled labour counts only as simple labour intensified or rather as multiplied simple labour a given quantity of skilled being considered equal to a greater quantity of simple labour experience shows that this reduction is constantly being made a commodity may be the product of the most skilled labour but its value by equating it to the product of simple unskilled labour represents a definite quantity of the latter labour alone the different proportions in which different sorts of labour are reduced to unskilled labour as their standard are established by a social process that goes on behind the backs of the producers and consequently appear to be fixed by custom for simplicity’s sake we shall henceforth account every kind of labour to be unskilled simple labour by this we do no more than save ourselves the trouble of making the reduction just as therefore in viewing the coat and linen as values we abstract from their different use values so it is with the labour represented by those values we disregard the difference between its useful forms weaving and tailoring as the use values coat and linen are combinations of special productive activities with cloth and yarn while the values coat and linen are on the other hand mere homogeneous congelations of undifferentiated labour so the labour embodied in these latter values does not count by virtue of its productive relation to cloth and yarn but only as being expenditure of human labour power tailoring and weaving are necessary factors in the creation of the use values coat and linen precisely because these two kinds of labour are of different qualities but only in so far as abstraction is made from their special qualities only in so far as both possess the same quality of being human labour do tailoring and weaving form the substance of the values of the same articles coats and linen however are not merely values but values of definite magnitude and according to our assumption the coat is worth twice as much as the ten yards of linen whence this difference in their values it is owing to the fact that the linen contains only half as much labour as the coat and consequently that in the production of the latter labour power must have been expended during twice the time necessary for the production of the former while therefore with reference to use value the labour contained in a commodity counts only qualitatively with reference to value it counts only quantitatively and must first be reduced to human labour pure and simple in the former case it is a question of how and what in the latter of how much how long a time since the magnitude of the value of a commodity represents only the quantity of labour embodied in it it follows that all commodities when taken in certain proportions must be equal in value if the productive power of all the different sorts of useful labour required for the production of a coat remains unchanged the sum of the values of the coats produced increases with their number if one coat represents x days’ labour two coats represent x days’ labour and so on but assume that the duration of the labour necessary for the production of a coat becomes doubled or halved in the first case one coat is worth as much as two coats were before in the second case two coats are only worth as much as one was before although in both cases one coat renders the same service as before and the useful labour embodied in it remains of the same quality but the quantity of labour spent on its production has altered an increase in the quantity of use values is an increase of material wealth with two coats two men can be clothed with one coat only one man nevertheless an increased quantity of material wealth may correspond to a simultaneous fall in the magnitude of its value this antagonistic movement has its origin in the twofold character of labour productive power has reference of course only to labour of some useful concrete form the efficacy of any special productive activity during a given time being dependent on its productiveness useful labour becomes therefore a more or less abundant source of products in proportion to the rise or fall of its productiveness on the other hand no change in this productiveness affects the labour represented by value since productive power is an attribute of the concrete useful forms of labour of course it can no longer have any bearing on that labour so soon as we make abstraction from those concrete useful forms however then productive power may vary the same labour exercised during equal periods of time always yields equal amounts of value but it will yield during equal periods of time different quantities of values in use more if the productive power rise fewer if it fall the same change in productive power which increases the fruitfulness of labour and in consequence the quantity of use values produced by that labour will diminish the total value of this increased quantity of use values provided such change shorten the total labour time necessary for their production and vice versâ on the one hand all labour is speaking physiologically an expenditure of human labour power and in its character of identical abstract human labour it creates and forms the value of commodities on the other hand all labour is the expenditure of human labour power in a special form and with a definite aim and in this its character of concrete useful labour it produces use values section the form of value or exchangevalue commodities come into the world in the shape of use values articles or goods such as iron linen corn c this is their plain homely bodily form they are however commodities only because they are something twofold both objects of utility and at the same time depositories of value they manifest themselves therefore as commodities or have the form of commodities only in so far as they have two forms a physical or natural form and a value form the reality of the value of commodities differs in this respect from dame quickly that we don’t know “where to have it” the value of commodities is the very opposite of the coarse materiality of their substance not an atom of matter enters into its composition turn and examine a single commodity by itself as we will yet in so far as it remains an object of value it seems impossible to grasp it if however we bear in mind that the value of commodities has a purely social reality and that they acquire this reality only in so far as they are expressions or embodiments of one identical social substance viz human labour it follows as a matter of course that value can only manifest itself in the social relation of commodity to commodity in fact we started from exchange value or the exchange relation of commodities in order to get at the value that lies hidden behind it we must now return to this form under which value first appeared to us every one knows if he knows nothing else that commodities have a value form common to them all and presenting a marked contrast with the varied bodily forms of their use values i mean their money form here however a task is set us the performance of which has never yet even been attempted by bourgeois economy the task of tracing the genesis of this money form of developing the expression of value implied in the value relation of commodities from its simplest almost imperceptible outline to the dazzling moneyform by doing this we shall at the same time solve the riddle presented by money the simplest valuerelation is evidently that of one commodity to some one other commodity of a different kind hence the relation between the values of two commodities supplies us with the simplest expression of the value of a single commodity a elementary or accidental form of value x commodity a y commodity b or x commodity a is worth y commodity b yards of linen coat or yards of linen are worth coat the two poles of the expression of value relative form and equivalent form the whole mystery of the form of value lies hidden in this elementary form its analysis therefore is our real difficulty here two different kinds of commodities in our example the linen and the coat evidently play two different parts the linen expresses its value in the coat the coat serves as the material in which that value is expressed the former plays an active the latter a passive part the value of the linen is represented as relative value or appears in relative form the coat officiates as equivalent or appears in equivalent form the relative form and the equivalent form are two intimately connected mutually dependent and inseparable elements of the expression of value but at the same time are mutually exclusive antagonistic extremes – ie poles of the same expression they are allotted respectively to the two different commodities brought into relation by that expression it is not possible to express the value of linen in linen yards of linen yards of linen is no expression of value on the contrary such an equation merely says that yards of linen are nothing else than yards of linen a definite quantity of the use value linen the value of the linen can therefore be expressed only relatively – ie in some other commodity the relative form of the value of the linen presupposes therefore the presence of some other commodity – here the coat – under the form of an equivalent on the other hand the commodity that figures as the equivalent cannot at the same time assume the relative form that second commodity is not the one whose value is expressed its function is merely to serve as the material in which the value of the first commodity is expressed no doubt the expression yards of linen coat or yards of linen are worth coat implies the opposite relation coat yards of linen or coat is worth yards of linen but in that case i must reverse the equation in order to express the value of the coat relatively and so soon as i do that the linen becomes the equivalent instead of the coat a single commodity cannot therefore simultaneously assume in the same expression of value both forms the very polarity of these forms makes them mutually exclusive whether then a commodity assumes the relative form or the opposite equivalent form depends entirely upon its accidental position in the expression of value – that is upon whether it is the commodity whose value is being expressed or the commodity in which value is being expressed the relative form of value a the nature and import of this form in order to discover how the elementary expression of the value of a commodity lies hidden in the value relation of two commodities we must in the first place consider the latter entirely apart from its quantitative aspect the usual mode of procedure is generally the reverse and in the value relation nothing is seen but the proportion between definite quantities of two different sorts of commodities that are considered equal to each other it is apt to be forgotten that the magnitudes of different things can be compared quantitatively only when those magnitudes are expressed in terms of the same unit it is only as expressions of such a unit that they are of the same denomination and therefore commensurable whether yards of linen coat or coats or x coats – that is whether a given quantity of linen is worth few or many coats every such statement implies that the linen and coats as magnitudes of value are expressions of the same unit things of the same kind linen coat is the basis of the equation but the two commodities whose identity of quality is thus assumed do not play the same part it is only the value of the linen that is expressed and how by its reference to the coat as its equivalent as something that can be exchanged for it in this relation the coat is the mode of existence of value is value embodied for only as such is it the same as the linen on the other hand the linen’s own value comes to the front receives independent expression for it is only as being value that it is comparable with the coat as a thing of equal value or exchangeable with the coat to borrow an illustration from chemistry butyric acid is a different substance from propyl formate yet both are made up of the same chemical substances carbon c hydrogen h and oxygen o and that too in like proportions – namely c h o if now we equate butyric acid to propyl formate then in the first place propyl formate would be in this relation merely a form of existence of c h o and in the second place we should be stating that butyric acid also consists of c h o therefore by thus equating the two substances expression would be given to their chemical composition while their different physical forms would be neglected if we say that as values commodities are mere congelations of human labour we reduce them by our analysis it is true to the abstraction value but we ascribe to this value no form apart from their bodily form it is otherwise in the value relation of one commodity to another here the one stands forth in its character of value by reason of its relation to the other by making the coat the equivalent of the linen we equate the labour embodied in the former to that in the latter now it is true that the tailoring which makes the coat is concrete labour of a different sort from the weaving which makes the linen but the act of equating it to the weaving reduces the tailoring to that which is really equal in the two kinds of labour to their common character of human labour in this roundabout way then the fact is expressed that weaving also in so far as it weaves value has nothing to distinguish it from tailoring and consequently is abstract human labour it is the expression of equivalence between different sorts of commodities that alone brings into relief the specific character of valuecreating labour and this it does by actually reducing the different varieties of labour embodied in the different kinds of commodities to their common quality of human labour in the abstract there is however something else required beyond the expression of the specific character of the labour of which the value of the linen consists human labour power in motion or human labour creates value but is not itself value it becomes value only in its congealed state when embodied in the form of some object in order to express the value of the linen as a congelation of human labour that value must be expressed as having objective existence as being a something materially different from the linen itself and yet a something common to the linen and all other commodities the problem is already solved when occupying the position of equivalent in the equation of value the coat ranks qualitatively as the equal of the linen as something of the same kind because it is value in this position it is a thing in which we see nothing but value or whose palpable bodily form represents value yet the coat itself the body of the commodity coat is a mere use value a coat as such no more tells us it is value than does the first piece of linen we take hold of this shows that when placed in valuerelation to the linen the coat signifies more than when out of that relation just as many a man strutting about in a gorgeous uniform counts for more than when in mufti in the production of the coat human labour power in the shape of tailoring must have been actually expended human labour is therefore accumulated in it in this aspect the coat is a depository of value but though worn to a thread it does not let this fact show through and as equivalent of the linen in the value equation it exists under this aspect alone counts therefore as embodied value as a body that is value a for instance cannot be “your majesty” to b unless at the same time majesty in b’s eyes assumes the bodily form of a and what is more with every new father of the people changes its features hair and many other things besides hence in the value equation in which the coat is the equivalent of the linen the coat officiates as the form of value the value of the commodity linen is expressed by the bodily form of the commodity coat the value of one by the use value of the other as a use value the linen is something palpably different from the coat as value it is the same as the coat and now has the appearance of a coat thus the linen acquires a value form different from its physical form the fact that it is value is made manifest by its equality with the coat just as the sheep’s nature of a christian is shown in his resemblance to the lamb of god we see then all that our analysis of the value of commodities has already told us is told us by the linen itself so soon as it comes into communication with another commodity the coat only it betrays its thoughts in that language with which alone it is familiar the language of commodities in order to tell us that its own value is created by labour in its abstract character of human labour it says that the coat in so far as it is worth as much as the linen and therefore is value consists of the same labour as the linen in order to inform us that its sublime reality as value is not the same as its buckram body it says that value has the appearance of a coat and consequently that so far as the linen is value it and the coat are as like as two peas we may here remark that the language of commodities has besides hebrew many other more or less correct dialects the german “wertsein” to be worth for instance expresses in a less striking manner than the romance verbs “valere” “valer” “valoir” that the equating of commodity b to commodity a is commodity a’s own mode of expressing its value paris vaut bien une messe paris is certainly worth a mass by means therefore of the valuerelation expressed in our equation the bodily form of commodity b becomes the value form of commodity a or the body of commodity b acts as a mirror to the value of commodity a by putting itself in relation with commodity b as value in propriâ personâ as the matter of which human labour is made up the commodity a converts the value in use b into the substance in which to express its a’s own value the value of a thus expressed in the use value of b has taken the form of relative value b quantitative determination of relative value every commodity whose value it is intended to express is a useful object of given quantity as bushels of corn or lbs of coffee and a given quantity of any commodity contains a definite quantity of human labour the value form must therefore not only express value generally but also value in definite quantity therefore in the value relation of commodity a to commodity b of the linen to the coat not only is the latter as value in general made the equal in quality of the linen but a definite quantity of coat coat is made the equivalent of a definite quantity yards of linen the equation yards of linen coat or yards of linen are worth one coat implies that the same quantity of value substance congealed labour is embodied in both that the two commodities have each cost the same amount of labour of the same quantity of labour time but the labour time necessary for the production of yards of linen or coat varies with every change in the productiveness of weaving or tailoring we have now to consider the influence of such changes on the quantitative aspect of the relative expression of value i let the value of the linen vary that of the coat remaining constant if say in consequence of the exhaustion of flaxgrowing soil the labour time necessary for the production of the linen be doubled the value of the linen will also be doubled instead of the equation yards of linen coat we should have yards of linen coats since coat would now contain only half the labour time embodied in yards of linen if on the other hand in consequence say of improved looms this labour time be reduced by onehalf the value of the linen would fall by onehalf consequently we should have yards of linen ½ coat the relative value of commodity a ie its value expressed in commodity b rises and falls directly as the value of a the value of b being supposed constant ii let the value of the linen remain constant while the value of the coat varies if under these circumstances in consequence for instance of a poor crop of wool the labour time necessary for the production of a coat becomes doubled we have instead of yards of linen coat yards of linen ½ coat if on the other hand the value of the coat sinks by onehalf then yards of linen coats hence if the value of commodity a remain constant its relative value expressed in commodity b rises and falls inversely as the value of b if we compare the different cases in i and ii we see that the same change of magnitude in relative value may arise from totally opposite causes thus the equation yards of linen coat becomes yards of linen coats either because the value of the linen has doubled or because the value of the coat has fallen by onehalf and it becomes yards of linen ½ coat either because the value of the linen has fallen by onehalf or because the value of the coat has doubled iii let the quantities of labour time respectively necessary for the production of the linen and the coat vary simultaneously in the same direction and in the same proportion in this case yards of linen continue equal to coat however much their values may have altered their change of value is seen as soon as they are compared with a third commodity whose value has remained constant if the values of all commodities rose or fell simultaneously and in the same proportion their relative values would remain unaltered their real change of value would appear from the diminished or increased quantity of commodities produced in a given time iv the labour time respectively necessary for the production of the linen and the coat and therefore the value of these commodities may simultaneously vary in the same direction but at unequal rates or in opposite directions or in other ways the effect of all these possible different variations on the relative value of a commodity may be deduced from the results of i ii and iii thus real changes in the magnitude of value are neither unequivocally nor exhaustively reflected in their relative expression that is in the equation expressing the magnitude of relative value the relative value of a commodity may vary although its value remains constant its relative value may remain constant although its value varies and finally simultaneous variations in the magnitude of value and in that of its relative expression by no means necessarily correspond in amount the equivalent form of value we have seen that commodity a the linen by expressing its value in the use value of a commodity differing in kind the coat at the same time impresses upon the latter a specific form of value namely that of the equivalent the commodity linen manifests its quality of having a value by the fact that the coat without having assumed a value form different from its bodily form is equated to the linen the fact that the latter therefore has a value is expressed by saying that the coat is directly exchangeable with it therefore when we say that a commodity is in the equivalent form we express the fact that it is directly exchangeable with other commodities when one commodity such as a coat serves as the equivalent of another such as linen and coats consequently acquire the characteristic property of being directly exchangeable with linen we are far from knowing in what proportion the two are exchangeable the value of the linen being given in magnitude that proportion depends on the value of the coat whether the coat serves as the equivalent and the linen as relative value or the linen as the equivalent and the coat as relative value the magnitude of the coat’s value is determined independently of its value form by the labour time necessary for its production but whenever the coat assumes in the equation of value the position of equivalent its value acquires no quantitative expression on the contrary the commodity coat now figures only as a definite quantity of some article for instance yards of linen are worth – what coats because the commodity coat here plays the part of equivalent because the usevalue coat as opposed to the linen figures as an embodiment of value therefore a definite number of coats suffices to express the definite quantity of value in the linen two coats may therefore express the quantity of value of yards of linen but they can never express the quantity of their own value a superficial observation of this fact namely that in the equation of value the equivalent figures exclusively as a simple quantity of some article of some use value has misled bailey as also many others both before and after him into seeing in the expression of value merely a quantitative relation the truth being that when a commodity acts as equivalent no quantitative determination of its value is expressed the first peculiarity that strikes us in considering the form of the equivalent is this use value becomes the form of manifestation the phenomenal form of its opposite value the bodily form of the commodity becomes its value form but mark well that this quid pro quo exists in the case of any commodity b only when some other commodity a enters into a value relation with it and then only within the limits of this relation since no commodity can stand in the relation of equivalent to itself and thus turn its own bodily shape into the expression of its own value every commodity is compelled to choose some other commodity for its equivalent and to accept the use value that is to say the bodily shape of that other commodity as the form of its own value one of the measures that we apply to commodities as material substances as use values will serve to illustrate this point a sugarloaf being a body is heavy and therefore has weight but we can neither see nor touch this weight we then take various pieces of iron whose weight has been determined beforehand the iron as iron is no more the form of manifestation of weight than is the sugarloaf nevertheless in order to express the sugarloaf as so much weight we put it into a weightrelation with the iron in this relation the iron officiates as a body representing nothing but weight a certain quantity of iron therefore serves as the measure of the weight of the sugar and represents in relation to the sugarloaf weight embodied the form of manifestation of weight this part is played by the iron only within this relation into which the sugar or any other body whose weight has to be determined enters with the iron were they not both heavy they could not enter into this relation and the one could therefore not serve as the expression of the weight of the other when we throw both into the scales we see in reality that as weight they are both the same and that therefore when taken in proper proportions they have the same weight just as the substance iron as a measure of weight represents in relation to the sugarloaf weight alone so in our expression of value the material object coat in relation to the linen represents value alone here however the analogy ceases the iron in the expression of the weight of the sugarloaf represents a natural property common to both bodies namely their weight but the coat in the expression of value of the linen represents a nonnatural property of both something purely social namely their value since the relative form of value of a commodity – the linen for example – expresses the value of that commodity as being something wholly different from its substance and properties as being for instance coatlike we see that this expression itself indicates that some social relation lies at the bottom of it with the equivalent form it is just the contrary the very essence of this form is that the material commodity itself – the coat – just as it is expresses value and is endowed with the form of value by nature itself of course this holds good only so long as the value relation exists in which the coat stands in the position of equivalent to the linen since however the properties of a thing are not the result of its relations to other things but only manifest themselves in such relations the coat seems to be endowed with its equivalent form its property of being directly exchangeable just as much by nature as it is endowed with the property of being heavy or the capacity to keep us warm hence the enigmatical character of the equivalent form which escapes the notice of the bourgeois political economist until this form completely developed confronts him in the shape of money he then seeks to explain away the mystical character of gold and silver by substituting for them less dazzling commodities and by reciting with ever renewed satisfaction the catalogue of all possible commodities which at one time or another have played the part of equivalent he has not the least suspicion that the most simple expression of value such as yds of linen coat already propounds the riddle of the equivalent form for our solution the body of the commodity that serves as the equivalent figures as the materialisation of human labour in the abstract and is at the same time the product of some specifically useful concrete labour this concrete labour becomes therefore the medium for expressing abstract human labour if on the one hand the coat ranks as nothing but the embodiment of abstract human labour so on the other hand the tailoring which is actually embodied in it counts as nothing but the form under which that abstract labour is realised in the expression of value of the linen the utility of the tailoring consists not in making clothes but in making an object which we at once recognise to be value and therefore to be a congelation of labour but of labour indistinguishable from that realised in the value of the linen in order to act as such a mirror of value the labour of tailoring must reflect nothing besides its own abstract quality of being human labour generally in tailoring as well as in weaving human labour power is expended both therefore possess the general property of being human labour and may therefore in certain cases such as in the production of value have to be considered under this aspect alone there is nothing mysterious in this but in the expression of value there is a complete turn of the tables for instance how is the fact to be expressed that weaving creates the value of the linen not by virtue of being weaving as such but by reason of its general property of being human labour simply by opposing to weaving that other particular form of concrete labour in this instance tailoring which produces the equivalent of the product of weaving just as the coat in its bodily form became a direct expression of value so now does tailoring a concrete form of labour appear as the direct and palpable embodiment of human labour generally hence the second peculiarity of the equivalent form is that concrete labour becomes the form under which its opposite abstract human labour manifests itself but because this concrete labour tailoring in our case ranks as and is directly identified with undifferentiated human labour it also ranks as identical with any other sort of labour and therefore with that embodied in the linen consequently although like all other commodityproducing labour it is the labour of private individuals yet at the same time it ranks as labour directly social in its character this is the reason why it results in a product directly exchangeable with other commodities we have then a third peculiarity of the equivalent form namely that the labour of private individuals takes the form of its opposite labour directly social in its form the two latter peculiarities of the equivalent form will become more intelligible if we go back to the great thinker who was the first to analyse so many forms whether of thought society or nature and amongst them also the form of value i mean aristotle in the first place he clearly enunciates that the money form of commodities is only the further development of the simple form of value – ie of the expression of the value of one commodity in some other commodity taken at random for he says beds house clinai pente anti oiciaς is not to be distinguished from beds so much money clinai pente anti oson ai pente clinai he further sees that the value relation which gives rise to this expression makes it necessary that the house should qualitatively be made the equal of the bed and that without such an equalisation these two clearly different things could not be compared with each other as commensurable quantities “exchange” he says “cannot take place without equality and equality not without commensurability out isothς mh oushς snmmetriaς here however he comes to a stop and gives up the further analysis of the form of value “it is however in reality impossible th men oun alhqeia adunaton that such unlike things can be commensurable” – ie qualitatively equal such an equalisation can only be something foreign to their real nature consequently only “a makeshift for practical purposes” aristotle therefore himself tells us what barred the way to his further analysis it was the absence of any concept of value what is that equal something that common substance which admits of the value of the beds being expressed by a house such a thing in truth cannot exist says aristotle and why not compared with the beds the house does represent something equal to them in so far as it represents what is really equal both in the beds and the house and that is – human labour there was however an important fact which prevented aristotle from seeing that to attribute value to commodities is merely a mode of expressing all labour as equal human labour and consequently as labour of equal quality greek society was founded upon slavery and had therefore for its natural basis the inequality of men and of their labour powers the secret of the expression of value namely that all kinds of labour are equal and equivalent because and so far as they are human labour in general cannot be deciphered until the notion of human equality has already acquired the fixity of a popular prejudice this however is possible only in a society in which the great mass of the produce of labour takes the form of commodities in which consequently the dominant relation between man and man is that of owners of commodities the brilliancy of aristotle’s genius is shown by this alone that he discovered in the expression of the value of commodities a relation of equality the peculiar conditions of the society in which he lived alone prevented him from discovering what “in truth” was at the bottom of this equality the elementary form of value considered as a whole the elementary form of value of a commodity is contained in the equation expressing its value relation to another commodity of a different kind or in its exchange relation to the same the value of commodity a is qualitatively expressed by the fact that commodity b is directly exchangeable with it its value is quantitatively expressed by the fact that a definite quantity of b is exchangeable with a definite quantity of a in other words the value of a commodity obtains independent and definite expression by taking the form of exchange value when at the beginning of this chapter we said in common parlance that a commodity is both a use value and an exchange value we were accurately speaking wrong a commodity is a use value or object of utility and a value it manifests itself as this twofold thing that it is as soon as its value assumes an independent form – viz the form of exchange value it never assumes this form when isolated but only when placed in a value or exchange relation with another commodity of a different kind when once we know this such a mode of expression does no harm it simply serves as an abbreviation our analysis has shown that the form or expression of the value of a commodity originates in the nature of value and not that value and its magnitude originate in the mode of their expression as exchange value this however is the delusion as well of the mercantilists and their recent revivers ferrier ganilh and others as also of their antipodes the modern bagmen of freetrade such as bastiat the mercantilists lay special stress on the qualitative aspect of the expression of value and consequently on the equivalent form of commodities which attains its full perfection in money the modern hawkers of freetrade who must get rid of their article at any price on the other hand lay most stress on the quantitative aspect of the relative form of value for them there consequently exists neither value nor magnitude of value anywhere except in its expression by means of the exchange relation of commodities that is in the daily list of prices current macleod who has taken upon himself to dress up the confused ideas of lombard street in the most learned finery is a successful cross between the superstitious mercantilists and the enlightened freetrade bagmen a close scrutiny of the expression of the value of a in terms of b contained in the equation expressing the value relation of a to b has shown us that within that relation the bodily form of a figures only as a use value the bodily form of b only as the form or aspect of value the opposition or contrast existing internally in each commodity between use value and value is therefore made evident externally by two commodities being placed in such relation to each other that the commodity whose value it is sought to express figures directly as a mere use value while the commodity in which that value is to be expressed figures directly as mere exchange value hence the elementary form of value of a commodity is the elementary form in which the contrast contained in that commodity between use value and value becomes apparent every product of labour is in all states of society a use value but it is only at a definite historical epoch in a society’s development that such a product becomes a commodity viz at the epoch when the labour spent on the production of a useful article becomes expressed as one of the objective qualities of that article ie as its value it therefore follows that the elementary value form is also the primitive form under which a product of labour appears historically as a commodity and that the gradual transformation of such products into commodities proceeds pari passu with the development of the value form we perceive at first sight the deficiencies of the elementary form of value it is a mere germ which must undergo a series of metamorphoses before it can ripen into the price form the expression of the value of commodity a in terms of any other commodity b merely distinguishes the value from the use value of a and therefore places a merely in a relation of exchange with a single different commodity b but it is still far from expressing a’s qualitative equality and quantitative proportionality to all commodities to the elementary relative value form of a commodity there corresponds the single equivalent form of one other commodity thus in the relative expression of value of the linen the coat assumes the form of equivalent or of being directly exchangeable only in relation to a single commodity the linen nevertheless the elementary form of value passes by an easy transition into a more complete form it is true that by means of the elementary form the value of a commodity a becomes expressed in terms of one and only one other commodity but that one may be a commodity of any kind coat iron corn or anything else therefore according as a is placed in relation with one or the other we get for one and the same commodity different elementary expressions of value the number of such possible expressions is limited only by the number of the different kinds of commodities distinct from it the isolated expression of a’s value is therefore convertible into a series prolonged to any length of the different elementary expressions of that value b total or expanded form of value z com a u com b or v com c or w com d or com e or c yards of linen coat or lbs tea or lbs coffee or quarter corn or ounces gold or ½ ton iron or c the expanded relative form of value the value of a single commodity the linen for example is now expressed in terms of numberless other elements of the world of commodities every other commodity now becomes a mirror of the linen’s value it is thus that for the first time this value shows itself in its true light as a congelation of undifferentiated human labour for the labour that creates it now stands expressly revealed as labour that ranks equally with every other sort of human labour no matter what its form whether tailoring ploughing mining c and no matter therefore whether it is realised in coats corn iron or gold the linen by virtue of the form of its value now stands in a social relation no longer with only one other kind of commodity but with the whole world of commodities as a commodity it is a citizen of that world at the same time the interminable series of value equations implies that as regards the value of a commodity it is a matter of indifference under what particular form or kind of use value it appears in the first form yds of linen coat it might for ought that otherwise appears be pure accident that these two commodities are exchangeable in definite quantities in the second form on the contrary we perceive at once the background that determines and is essentially different from this accidental appearance the value of the linen remains unaltered in magnitude whether expressed in coats coffee or iron or in numberless different commodities the property of as many different owners the accidental relation between two individual commodityowners disappears it becomes plain that it is not the exchange of commodities which regulates the magnitude of their value but on the contrary that it is the magnitude of their value which controls their exchange proportions the particular equivalent form each commodity such as coat tea corn iron c figures in the expression of value of the linen as an equivalent and consequently as a thing that is value the bodily form of each of these commodities figures now as a particular equivalent form one out of many in the same way the manifold concrete useful kinds of labour embodied in these different commodities rank now as so many different forms of the realisation or manifestation of undifferentiated human labour defects of the total or expanded form of value in the first place the relative expression of value is incomplete because the series representing it is interminable the chain of which each equation of value is a link is liable at any moment to be lengthened by each new kind of commodity that comes into existence and furnishes the material for a fresh expression of value in the second place it is a manycoloured mosaic of disparate and independent expressions of value and lastly if as must be the case the relative value of each commodity in turn becomes expressed in this expanded form we get for each of them a relative value form different in every case and consisting of an interminable series of expressions of value the defects of the expanded relative value form are reflected in the corresponding equivalent form since the bodily form of each single commodity is one particular equivalent form amongst numberless others we have on the whole nothing but fragmentary equivalent forms each excluding the others in the same way also the special concrete useful kind of labour embodied in each particular equivalent is presented only as a particular kind of labour and therefore not as an exhaustive representative of human labour generally the latter indeed gains adequate manifestation in the totality of its manifold particular concrete forms but in that case its expression in an infinite series is ever incomplete and deficient in unity the expanded relative value form is however nothing but the sum of the elementary relative expressions or equations of the first kind such as yards of linen coat yards of linen lbs of tea etc each of these implies the corresponding inverted equation coat yards of linen lbs of tea yards of linen etc in fact when a person exchanges his linen for many other commodities and thus expresses its value in a series of other commodities it necessarily follows that the various owners of the latter exchange them for the linen and consequently express the value of their various commodities in one and the same third commodity the linen if then we reverse the series yards of linen coat or lbs of tea etc that is to say if we give expression to the converse relation already implied in the series we get c the general form of value coat lbs of tea lbs of coffee quarter of corn ounces of gold ½ a ton of iron x commodity a etc yards of linen the altered character of the form of value all commodities now express their value in an elementary form because in a single commodity with unity because in one and the same commodity this form of value is elementary and the same for all therefore general the forms a and b were fit only to express the value of a commodity as something distinct from its use value or material form the first form a furnishes such equations as the following – coat yards of linen lbs of tea ½ a ton of iron the value of the coat is equated to linen that of the tea to iron but to be equated to linen and again to iron is to be as different as are linen and iron this form it is plain occurs practically only in the first beginning when the products of labour are converted into commodities by accidental and occasional exchanges the second form b distinguishes in a more adequate manner than the first the value of a commodity from its use value for the value of the coat is there placed in contrast under all possible shapes with the bodily form of the coat it is equated to linen to iron to tea in short to everything else only not to itself the coat on the other hand any general expression of value common to all is directly excluded for in the equation of value of each commodity all other commodities now appear only under the form of equivalents the expanded form of value comes into actual existence for the first time so soon as a particular product of labour such as cattle is no longer exceptionally but habitually exchanged for various other commodities the third and lastly developed form expresses the values of the whole world of commodities in terms of a single commodity set apart for the purpose namely the linen and thus represents to us their values by means of their equality with linen the value of every commodity is now by being equated to linen not only differentiated from its own use value but from all other use values generally and is by that very fact expressed as that which is common to all commodities by this form commodities are for the first time effectively brought into relation with one another as values or made to appear as exchange values the two earlier forms either express the value of each commodity in terms of a single commodity of a different kind or in a series of many such commodities in both cases it is so to say the special business of each single commodity to find an expression for its value and this it does without the help of the others these others with respect to the former play the passive parts of equivalents the general form of value c results from the joint action of the whole world of commodities and from that alone a commodity can acquire a general expression of its value only by all other commodities simultaneously with it expressing their values in the same equivalent and every new commodity must follow suit it thus becomes evident that since the existence of commodities as values is purely social this social existence can be expressed by the totality of their social relations alone and consequently that the form of their value must be a socially recognised form all commodities being equated to linen now appear not only as qualitatively equal as values generally but also as values whose magnitudes are capable of comparison by expressing the magnitudes of their values in one and the same material the linen those magnitudes are also compared with each other for instance lbs of tea yards of linen and lbs of coffee yards of linen therefore lbs of tea lbs of coffee in other words there is contained in lb of coffee only onefourth as much substance of value – labour – as is contained in lb of tea the general form of relative value embracing the whole world of commodities converts the single commodity that is excluded from the rest and made to play the part of equivalent – here the linen – into the universal equivalent the bodily form of the linen is now the form assumed in common by the values of all commodities it therefore becomes directly exchangeable with all and every of them the substance linen becomes the visible incarnation the social chrysalis state of every kind of human labour weaving which is the labour of certain private individuals producing a particular article linen acquires in consequence a social character the character of equality with all other kinds of labour the innumerable equations of which the general form of value is composed equate in turn the labour embodied in the linen to that embodied in every other commodity and they thus convert weaving into the general form of manifestation of undifferentiated human labour in this manner the labour realised in the values of commodities is presented not only under its negative aspect under which abstraction is made from every concrete form and useful property of actual work but its own positive nature is made to reveal itself expressly the general value form is the reduction of all kinds of actual labour to their common character of being human labour generally of being the expenditure of human labour power the general value form which represents all products of labour as mere congelations of undifferentiated human labour shows by its very structure that it is the social resumé of the world of commodities that form consequently makes it indisputably evident that in the world of commodities the character possessed by all labour of being human labour constitutes its specific social character the interdependent development of the relative form of value and of the equivalent form the degree of development of the relative form of value corresponds to that of the equivalent form but we must bear in mind that the development of the latter is only the expression and result of the development of the former the primary or isolated relative form of value of one commodity converts some other commodity into an isolated equivalent the expanded form of relative value which is the expression of the value of one commodity in terms of all other commodities endows those other commodities with the character of particular equivalents differing in kind and lastly a particular kind of commodity acquires the character of universal equivalent because all other commodities make it the material in which they uniformly express their value the antagonism between the relative form of value and the equivalent form the two poles of the value form is developed concurrently with that form itself the first form yds of linen one coat already contains this antagonism without as yet fixing it according as we read this equation forwards or backwards the parts played by the linen and the coat are different in the one case the relative value of the linen is expressed in the coat in the other case the relative value of the coat is expressed in the linen in this first form of value therefore it is difficult to grasp the polar contrast form b shows that only one single commodity at a time can completely expand its relative value and that it acquires this expanded form only because and in so far as all other commodities are with respect to it equivalents here we cannot reverse the equation as we can the equation yds of linen coat without altering its general character and converting it from the expanded form of value into the general form of value finally the form c gives to the world of commodities a general social relative form of value because and in so far as thereby all commodities with the exception of one are excluded from the equivalent form a single commodity the linen appears therefore to have acquired the character of direct exchangeability with every other commodity because and in so far as this character is denied to every other commodity the commodity that figures as universal equivalent is on the other hand excluded from the relative value form if the linen or any other commodity serving as universal equivalent were at the same time to share in the relative form of value it would have to serve as its own equivalent we should then have yds of linen yds of linen this tautology expresses neither value nor magnitude of value in order to express the relative value of the universal equivalent we must rather reverse the form c this equivalent has no relative form of value in common with other commodities but its value is relatively expressed by a never ending series of other commodities thus the expanded form of relative value or form b now shows itself as the specific form of relative value for the equivalent commodity transition from the general form of value to the money form the universal equivalent form is a form of value in general it can therefore be assumed by any commodity on the other hand if a commodity be found to have assumed the universal equivalent form form c this is only because and in so far as it has been excluded from the rest of all other commodities as their equivalent and that by their own act and from the moment that this exclusion becomes finally restricted to one particular commodity from that moment only the general form of relative value of the world of commodities obtains real consistence and general social validity the particular commodity with whose bodily form the equivalent form is thus socially identified now becomes the money commodity or serves as money it becomes the special social function of that commodity and consequently its social monopoly to play within the world of commodities the part of the universal equivalent amongst the commodities which in form b figure as particular equivalents of the linen and in form c express in common their relative values in linen this foremost place has been attained by one in particular – namely gold if then in form c we replace the linen by gold we get d the moneyform yards of linen coat lbs of tea lbs of coffee quarter of corn ounces of gold ½ a ton of iron x commodity a ounces of gold in passing from form a to form b and from the latter to form c the changes are fundamental on the other hand there is no difference between forms c and d except that in the latter gold has assumed the equivalent form in the place of linen gold is in form d what linen was in form c – the universal equivalent the progress consists in this alone that the character of direct and universal exchangeability – in other words that the universal equivalent form – has now by social custom become finally identified with the substance gold gold is now money with reference to all other commodities only because it was previously with reference to them a simple commodity like all other commodities it was also capable of serving as an equivalent either as simple equivalent in isolated exchanges or as particular equivalent by the side of others gradually it began to serve within varying limits as universal equivalent so soon as it monopolises this position in the expression of value for the world of commodities it becomes the money commodity and then and not till then does form d become distinct from form c and the general form of value become changed into the money form the elementary expression of the relative value of a single commodity such as linen in terms of the commodity such as gold that plays the part of money is the price form of that commodity the price form of the linen is therefore yards of linen ounces of gold or if ounces of gold when coined are £ yards of linen £ the difficulty in forming a concept of the money form consists in clearly comprehending the universal equivalent form and as a necessary corollary the general form of value form c the latter is deducible from form b the expanded form of value the essential component element of which we saw is form a yards of linen coat or x commodity a y commodity b the simple commodity form is therefore the germ of the money form section the fetishism of commodities and the secret thereof a commodity appears at first sight a very trivial thing and easily understood its analysis shows that it is in reality a very queer thing abounding in metaphysical subtleties and theological niceties so far as it is a value in use there is nothing mysterious about it whether we consider it from the point of view that by its properties it is capable of satisfying human wants or from the point that those properties are the product of human labour it is as clear as noonday that man by his industry changes the forms of the materials furnished by nature in such a way as to make them useful to him the form of wood for instance is altered by making a table out of it yet for all that the table continues to be that common everyday thing wood but so soon as it steps forth as a commodity it is changed into something transcendent it not only stands with its feet on the ground but in relation to all other commodities it stands on its head and evolves out of its wooden brain grotesque ideas far more wonderful than “tableturning” ever was a the mystical character of commodities does not originate therefore in their use value just as little does it proceed from the nature of the determining factors of value for in the first place however varied the useful kinds of labour or productive activities may be it is a physiological fact that they are functions of the human organism and that each such function whatever may be its nature or form is essentially the expenditure of human brain nerves muscles c secondly with regard to that which forms the groundwork for the quantitative determination of value namely the duration of that expenditure or the quantity of labour it is quite clear that there is a palpable difference between its quantity and quality in all states of society the labour time that it costs to produce the means of subsistence must necessarily be an object of interest to mankind though not of equal interest in different stages of development and lastly from the moment that men in any way work for one another their labour assumes a social form whence then arises the enigmatical character of the product of labour so soon as it assumes the form of commodities clearly from this form itself the equality of all sorts of human labour is expressed objectively by their products all being equally values the measure of the expenditure of labour power by the duration of that expenditure takes the form of the quantity of value of the products of labour and finally the mutual relations of the producers within which the social character of their labour affirms itself take the form of a social relation between the products a commodity is therefore a mysterious thing simply because in it the social character of men’s labour appears to them as an objective character stamped upon the product of that labour because the relation of the producers to the sum total of their own labour is presented to them as a social relation existing not between themselves but between the products of their labour this is the reason why the products of labour become commodities social things whose qualities are at the same time perceptible and imperceptible by the senses in the same way the light from an object is perceived by us not as the subjective excitation of our optic nerve but as the objective form of something outside the eye itself but in the act of seeing there is at all events an actual passage of light from one thing to another from the external object to the eye there is a physical relation between physical things but it is different with commodities there the existence of the things quâ commodities and the value relation between the products of labour which stamps them as commodities have absolutely no connection with their physical properties and with the material relations arising therefrom there it is a definite social relation between men that assumes in their eyes the fantastic form of a relation between things in order therefore to find an analogy we must have recourse to the mistenveloped regions of the religious world in that world the productions of the human brain appear as independent beings endowed with life and entering into relation both with one another and the human race so it is in the world of commodities with the products of men’s hands this i call the fetishism which attaches itself to the products of labour so soon as they are produced as commodities and which is therefore inseparable from the production of commodities this fetishism of commodities has its origin as the foregoing analysis has already shown in the peculiar social character of the labour that produces them as a general rule articles of utility become commodities only because they are products of the labour of private individuals or groups of individuals who carry on their work independently of each other the sum total of the labour of all these private individuals forms the aggregate labour of society since the producers do not come into social contact with each other until they exchange their products the specific social character of each producer’s labour does not show itself except in the act of exchange in other words the labour of the individual asserts itself as a part of the labour of society only by means of the relations which the act of exchange establishes directly between the products and indirectly through them between the producers to the latter therefore the relations connecting the labour of one individual with that of the rest appear not as direct social relations between individuals at work but as what they really are material relations between persons and social relations between things it is only by being exchanged that the products of labour acquire as values one uniform social status distinct from their varied forms of existence as objects of utility this division of a product into a useful thing and a value becomes practically important only when exchange has acquired such an extension that useful articles are produced for the purpose of being exchanged and their character as values has therefore to be taken into account beforehand during production from this moment the labour of the individual producer acquires socially a twofold character on the one hand it must as a definite useful kind of labour satisfy a definite social want and thus hold its place as part and parcel of the collective labour of all as a branch of a social division of labour that has sprung up spontaneously on the other hand it can satisfy the manifold wants of the individual producer himself only in so far as the mutual exchangeability of all kinds of useful private labour is an established social fact and therefore the private useful labour of each producer ranks on an equality with that of all others the equalisation of the most different kinds of labour can be the result only of an abstraction from their inequalities or of reducing them to their common denominator viz expenditure of human labour power or human labour in the abstract the twofold social character of the labour of the individual appears to him when reflected in his brain only under those forms which are impressed upon that labour in everyday practice by the exchange of products in this way the character that his own labour possesses of being socially useful takes the form of the condition that the product must be not only useful but useful for others and the social character that his particular labour has of being the equal of all other particular kinds of labour takes the form that all the physically different articles that are the products of labour have one common quality viz that of having value hence when we bring the products of our labour into relation with each other as values it is not because we see in these articles the material receptacles of homogeneous human labour quite the contrary whenever by an exchange we equate as values our different products by that very act we also equate as human labour the different kinds of labour expended upon them we are not aware of this nevertheless we do it value therefore does not stalk about with a label describing what it is it is value rather that converts every product into a social hieroglyphic later on we try to decipher the hieroglyphic to get behind the secret of our own social products for to stamp an object of utility as a value is just as much a social product as language the recent scientific discovery that the products of labour so far as they are values are but material expressions of the human labour spent in their production marks indeed an epoch in the history of the development of the human race but by no means dissipates the mist through which the social character of labour appears to us to be an objective character of the products themselves the fact that in the particular form of production with which we are dealing viz the production of commodities the specific social character of private labour carried on independently consists in the equality of every kind of that labour by virtue of its being human labour which character therefore assumes in the product the form of value – this fact appears to the producers notwithstanding the discovery above referred to to be just as real and final as the fact that after the discovery by science of the component gases of air the atmosphere itself remained unaltered what first of all practically concerns producers when they make an exchange is the question how much of some other product they get for their own in what proportions the products are exchangeable when these proportions have by custom attained a certain stability they appear to result from the nature of the products so that for instance one ton of iron and two ounces of gold appear as naturally to be of equal value as a pound of gold and a pound of iron in spite of their different physical and chemical qualities appear to be of equal weight the character of having value when once impressed upon products obtains fixity only by reason of their acting and reacting upon each other as quantities of value these quantities vary continually independently of the will foresight and action of the producers to them their own social action takes the form of the action of objects which rule the producers instead of being ruled by them it requires a fully developed production of commodities before from accumulated experience alone the scientific conviction springs up that all the different kinds of private labour which are carried on independently of each other and yet as spontaneously developed branches of the social division of labour are continually being reduced to the quantitative proportions in which society requires them and why because in the midst of all the accidental and ever fluctuating exchange relations between the products the labour time socially necessary for their production forcibly asserts itself like an overriding law of nature the law of gravity thus asserts itself when a house falls about our ears the determination of the magnitude of value by labour time is therefore a secret hidden under the apparent fluctuations in the relative values of commodities its discovery while removing all appearance of mere accidentality from the determination of the magnitude of the values of products yet in no way alters the mode in which that determination takes place man’s reflections on the forms of social life and consequently also his scientific analysis of those forms take a course directly opposite to that of their actual historical development he begins post festum with the results of the process of development ready to hand before him the characters that stamp products as commodities and whose establishment is a necessary preliminary to the circulation of commodities have already acquired the stability of natural selfunderstood forms of social life before man seeks to decipher not their historical character for in his eyes they are immutable but their meaning consequently it was the analysis of the prices of commodities that alone led to the determination of the magnitude of value and it was the common expression of all commodities in money that alone led to the establishment of their characters as values it is however just this ultimate money form of the world of commodities that actually conceals instead of disclosing the social character of private labour and the social relations between the individual producers when i state that coats or boots stand in a relation to linen because it is the universal incarnation of abstract human labour the absurdity of the statement is selfevident nevertheless when the producers of coats and boots compare those articles with linen or what is the same thing with gold or silver as the universal equivalent they express the relation between their own private labour and the collective labour of society in the same absurd form the categories of bourgeois economy consist of such like forms they are forms of thought expressing with social validity the conditions and relations of a definite historically determined mode of production viz the production of commodities the whole mystery of commodities all the magic and necromancy that surrounds the products of labour as long as they take the form of commodities vanishes therefore so soon as we come to other forms of production since robinson crusoe’s experiences are a favourite theme with political economists let us take a look at him on his island moderate though he be yet some few wants he has to satisfy and must therefore do a little useful work of various sorts such as making tools and furniture taming goats fishing and hunting of his prayers and the like we take no account since they are a source of pleasure to him and he looks upon them as so much recreation in spite of the variety of his work he knows that his labour whatever its form is but the activity of one and the same robinson and consequently that it consists of nothing but different modes of human labour necessity itself compels him to apportion his time accurately between his different kinds of work whether one kind occupies a greater space in his general activity than another depends on the difficulties greater or less as the case may be to be overcome in attaining the useful effect aimed at this our friend robinson soon learns by experience and having rescued a watch ledger and pen and ink from the wreck commences like a trueborn briton to keep a set of books his stockbook contains a list of the objects of utility that belong to him of the operations necessary for their production and lastly of the labour time that definite quantities of those objects have on an average cost him all the relations between robinson and the objects that form this wealth of his own creation are here so simple and clear as to be intelligible without exertion even to mr sedley taylor and yet those relations contain all that is essential to the determination of value let us now transport ourselves from robinson’s island bathed in light to the european middle ages shrouded in darkness here instead of the independent man we find everyone dependent serfs and lords vassals and suzerains laymen and clergy personal dependence here characterises the social relations of production just as much as it does the other spheres of life organised on the basis of that production but for the very reason that personal dependence forms the groundwork of society there is no necessity for labour and its products to assume a fantastic form different from their reality they take the shape in the transactions of society of services in kind and payments in kind here the particular and natural form of labour and not as in a society based on production of commodities its general abstract form is the immediate social form of labour compulsory labour is just as properly measured by time as commodityproducing labour but every serf knows that what he expends in the service of his lord is a definite quantity of his own personal labour power the tithe to be rendered to the priest is more matter of fact than his blessing no matter then what we may think of the parts played by the different classes of people themselves in this society the social relations between individuals in the performance of their labour appear at all events as their own mutual personal relations and are not disguised under the shape of social relations between the products of labour for an example of labour in common or directly associated labour we have no occasion to go back to that spontaneously developed form which we find on the threshold of the history of all civilised races we have one close at hand in the patriarchal industries of a peasant family that produces corn cattle yarn linen and clothing for home use these different articles are as regards the family so many products of its labour but as between themselves they are not commodities the different kinds of labour such as tillage cattle tending spinning weaving and making clothes which result in the various products are in themselves and such as they are direct social functions because functions of the family which just as much as a society based on the production of commodities possesses a spontaneously developed system of division of labour the distribution of the work within the family and the regulation of the labour time of the several members depend as well upon differences of age and sex as upon natural conditions varying with the seasons the labour power of each individual by its very nature operates in this case merely as a definite portion of the whole labour power of the family and therefore the measure of the expenditure of individual labour power by its duration appears here by its very nature as a social character of their labour let us now picture to ourselves by way of change a community of free individuals carrying on their work with the means of production in common in which the labour power of all the different individuals is consciously applied as the combined labour power of the community all the characteristics of robinson’s labour are here repeated but with this difference that they are social instead of individual everything produced by him was exclusively the result of his own personal labour and therefore simply an object of use for himself the total product of our community is a social product one portion serves as fresh means of production and remains social but another portion is consumed by the members as means of subsistence a distribution of this portion amongst them is consequently necessary the mode of this distribution will vary with the productive organisation of the community and the degree of historical development attained by the producers we will assume but merely for the sake of a parallel with the production of commodities that the share of each individual producer in the means of subsistence is determined by his labour time labour time would in that case play a double part its apportionment in accordance with a definite social plan maintains the proper proportion between the different kinds of work to be done and the various wants of the community on the other hand it also serves as a measure of the portion of the common labour borne by each individual and of his share in the part of the total product destined for individual consumption the social relations of the individual producers with regard both to their labour and to its products are in this case perfectly simple and intelligible and that with regard not only to production but also to distribution the religious world is but the reflex of the real world and for a society based upon the production of commodities in which the producers in general enter into social relations with one another by treating their products as commodities and values whereby they reduce their individual private labour to the standard of homogeneous human labour – for such a society christianity with its cultus of abstract man more especially in its bourgeois developments protestantism deism c is the most fitting form of religion in the ancient asiatic and other ancient modes of production we find that the conversion of products into commodities and therefore the conversion of men into producers of commodities holds a subordinate place which however increases in importance as the primitive communities approach nearer and nearer to their dissolution trading nations properly so called exist in the ancient world only in its interstices like the gods of epicurus in the intermundia or like jews in the pores of polish society those ancient social organisms of production are as compared with bourgeois society extremely simple and transparent but they are founded either on the immature development of man individually who has not yet severed the umbilical cord that unites him with his fellowmen in a primitive tribal community or upon direct relations of subjection they can arise and exist only when the development of the productive power of labour has not risen beyond a low stage and when therefore the social relations within the sphere of material life between man and man and between man and nature are correspondingly narrow this narrowness is reflected in the ancient worship of nature and in the other elements of the popular religions the religious reflex of the real world can in any case only then finally vanish when the practical relations of everyday life offer to man none but perfectly intelligible and reasonable relations with regard to his fellowmen and to nature the lifeprocess of society which is based on the process of material production does not strip off its mystical veil until it is treated as production by freely associated men and is consciously regulated by them in accordance with a settled plan this however demands for society a certain material groundwork or set of conditions of existence which in their turn are the spontaneous product of a long and painful process of development political economy has indeed analysed however incompletely value and its magnitude and has discovered what lies beneath these forms but it has never once asked the question why labour is represented by the value of its product and labour time by the magnitude of that value these formulæ which bear it stamped upon them in unmistakable letters that they belong to a state of society in which the process of production has the mastery over man instead of being controlled by him such formulæ appear to the bourgeois intellect to be as much a selfevident necessity imposed by nature as productive labour itself hence forms of social production that preceded the bourgeois form are treated by the bourgeoisie in much the same way as the fathers of the church treated prechristian religions to what extent some economists are misled by the fetishism inherent in commodities or by the objective appearance of the social characteristics of labour is shown amongst other ways by the dull and tedious quarrel over the part played by nature in the formation of exchange value since exchange value is a definite social manner of expressing the amount of labour bestowed upon an object nature has no more to do with it than it has in fixing the course of exchange the mode of production in which the product takes the form of a commodity or is produced directly for exchange is the most general and most embryonic form of bourgeois production it therefore makes its appearance at an early date in history though not in the same predominating and characteristic manner as nowadays hence its fetish character is comparatively easy to be seen through but when we come to more concrete forms even this appearance of simplicity vanishes whence arose the illusions of the monetary system to it gold and silver when serving as money did not represent a social relation between producers but were natural objects with strange social properties and modern economy which looks down with such disdain on the monetary system does not its superstition come out as clear as noonday whenever it treats of capital how long is it since economy discarded the physiocratic illusion that rents grow out of the soil and not out of society but not to anticipate we will content ourselves with yet another example relating to the commodity form could commodities themselves speak they would say our use value may be a thing that interests men it is no part of us as objects what however does belong to us as objects is our value our natural intercourse as commodities proves it in the eyes of each other we are nothing but exchange values now listen how those commodities speak through the mouth of the economist “value” – ie exchange value “is a property of things riches” – ie use value “of man value in this sense necessarily implies exchanges riches do not” “riches” use value “are the attribute of men value is the attribute of commodities a man or a community is rich a pearl or a diamond is valuable” a pearl or a diamond is valuable as a pearl or a diamond so far no chemist has ever discovered exchange value either in a pearl or a diamond the economic discoverers of this chemical element who bythebye lay special claim to critical acumen find however that the use value of objects belongs to them independently of their material properties while their value on the other hand forms a part of them as objects what confirms them in this view is the peculiar circumstance that the use value of objects is realised without exchange by means of a direct relation between the objects and man while on the other hand their value is realised only by exchange that is by means of a social process who fails here to call to mind our good friend dogberry who informs neighbour seacoal that “to be a wellfavoured man is the gift of fortune but reading and writing comes by nature” chapter exchange it is plain that commodities cannot go to market and make exchanges of their own account we must therefore have recourse to their guardians who are also their owners commodities are things and therefore without power of resistance against man if they are wanting in docility he can use force in other words he can take possession of them in order that these objects may enter into relation with each other as commodities their guardians must place themselves in relation to one another as persons whose will resides in those objects and must behave in such a way that each does not appropriate the commodity of the other and part with his own except by means of an act done by mutual consent they must therefore mutually recognise in each other the rights of private proprietors this juridical relation which thus expresses itself in a contract whether such contract be part of a developed legal system or not is a relation between two wills and is but the reflex of the real economic relation between the two it is this economic relation that determines the subjectmatter comprised in each such juridical act the persons exist for one another merely as representatives of and therefore as owners of commodities in the course of our investigation we shall find in general that the characters who appear on the economic stage are but the personifications of the economic relations that exist between them what chiefly distinguishes a commodity from its owner is the fact that it looks upon every other commodity as but the form of appearance of its own value a born leveller and a cynic it is always ready to exchange not only soul but body with any and every other commodity be the same more repulsive than maritornes herself the owner makes up for this lack in the commodity of a sense of the concrete by his own five and more senses his commodity possesses for himself no immediate usevalue otherwise he would not bring it to the market it has usevalue for others but for himself its only direct usevalue is that of being a depository of exchangevalue and consequently a means of exchange therefore he makes up his mind to part with it for commodities whose value in use is of service to him all commodities are nonusevalues for their owners and usevalues for their nonowners consequently they must all change hands but this change of hands is what constitutes their exchange and the latter puts them in relation with each other as values and realises them as values hence commodities must be realised as values before they can be realised as usevalues on the other hand they must show that they are usevalues before they can be realised as values for the labour spent upon them counts effectively only in so far as it is spent in a form that is useful for others whether that labour is useful for others and its product consequently capable of satisfying the wants of others can be proved only by the act of exchange every owner of a commodity wishes to part with it in exchange only for those commodities whose usevalue satisfies some want of his looked at in this way exchange is for him simply a private transaction on the other hand he desires to realise the value of his commodity to convert it into any other suitable commodity of equal value irrespective of whether his own commodity has or has not any usevalue for the owner of the other from this point of view exchange is for him a social transaction of a general character but one and the same set of transactions cannot be simultaneously for all owners of commodities both exclusively private and exclusively social and general let us look at the matter a little closer to the owner of a commodity every other commodity is in regard to his own a particular equivalent and consequently his own commodity is the universal equivalent for all the others but since this applies to every owner there is in fact no commodity acting as universal equivalent and the relative value of commodities possesses no general form under which they can be equated as values and have the magnitude of their values compared so far therefore they do not confront each other as commodities but only as products or usevalues in their difficulties our commodity owners think like faust “im anfang war die tat” “in the beginning was the deed” – goethe faust they therefore acted and transacted before they thought instinctively they conform to the laws imposed by the nature of commodities they cannot bring their commodities into relation as values and therefore as commodities except by comparing them with some one other commodity as the universal equivalent that we saw from the analysis of a commodity but a particular commodity cannot become the universal equivalent except by a social act the social action therefore of all other commodities sets apart the particular commodity in which they all represent their values thereby the bodily form of this commodity becomes the form of the socially recognised universal equivalent to be the universal equivalent becomes by this social process the specific function of the commodity thus excluded by the rest thus it becomes – money “illi unum consilium habent et virtutem et potestatem suam bestiae tradunt et ne quis possit emere aut vendere nisi qui habet characterem aut nomen bestiae aut numerum nominis ejus” “these have one mind and shall give their power and strength unto the beast” revelations “and that no man might buy or sell save he that had the mark or the name of the beast or the number of his name” revelations apocalypse money is a crystal formed of necessity in the course of the exchanges whereby different products of labour are practically equated to one another and thus by practice converted into commodities the historical progress and extension of exchanges develops the contrast latent in commodities between usevalue and value the necessity for giving an external expression to this contrast for the purposes of commercial intercourse urges on the establishment of an independent form of value and finds no rest until it is once for all satisfied by the differentiation of commodities into commodities and money at the same rate then as the conversion of products into commodities is being accomplished so also is the conversion of one special commodity into money the direct barter of products attains the elementary form of the relative expression of value in one respect but not in another that form is x commodity a y commodity b the form of direct barter is x usevalue a y usevalue b the articles a and b in this case are not as yet commodities but become so only by the act of barter the first step made by an object of utility towards acquiring exchangevalue is when it forms a nonusevalue for its owner and that happens when it forms a superfluous portion of some article required for his immediate wants objects in themselves are external to man and consequently alienable by him in order that this alienation may be reciprocal it is only necessary for men by a tacit understanding to treat each other as private owners of those alienable objects and by implication as independent individuals but such a state of reciprocal independence has no existence in a primitive society based on property in common whether such a society takes the form of a patriarchal family an ancient indian community or a peruvian inca state the exchange of commodities therefore first begins on the boundaries of such communities at their points of contact with other similar communities or with members of the latter so soon however as products once become commodities in the external relations of a community they also by reaction become so in its internal intercourse the proportions in which they are exchangeable are at first quite a matter of chance what makes them exchangeable is the mutual desire of their owners to alienate them meantime the need for foreign objects of utility gradually establishes itself the constant repetition of exchange makes it a normal social act in the course of time therefore some portion at least of the products of labour must be produced with a special view to exchange from that moment the distinction becomes firmly established between the utility of an object for the purposes of consumption and its utility for the purposes of exchange its usevalue becomes distinguished from its exchangevalue on the other hand the quantitative proportion in which the articles are exchangeable becomes dependent on their production itself custom stamps them as values with definite magnitudes in the direct barter of products each commodity is directly a means of exchange to its owner and to all other persons an equivalent but that only in so far as it has usevalue for them at this stage therefore the articles exchanged do not acquire a valueform independent of their own usevalue or of the individual needs of the exchangers the necessity for a valueform grows with the increasing number and variety of the commodities exchanged the problem and the means of solution arise simultaneously commodityowners never equate their own commodities to those of others and exchange them on a large scale without different kinds of commodities belonging to different owners being exchangeable for and equated as values to one and the same special article such lastmentioned article by becoming the equivalent of various other commodities acquires at once though within narrow limits the character of a general social equivalent this character comes and goes with the momentary social acts that called it into life in turns and transiently it attaches itself first to this and then to that commodity but with the development of exchange it fixes itself firmly and exclusively to particular sorts of commodities and becomes crystallised by assuming the moneyform the particular kind of commodity to which it sticks is at first a matter of accident nevertheless there are two circumstances whose influence is decisive the moneyform attaches itself either to the most important articles of exchange from outside and these in fact are primitive and natural forms in which the exchangevalue of home products finds expression or else it attaches itself to the object of utility that forms like cattle the chief portion of indigenous alienable wealth nomad races are the first to develop the moneyform because all their worldly goods consist of moveable objects and are therefore directly alienable and because their mode of life by continually bringing them into contact with foreign communities solicits the exchange of products man has often made man himself under the form of slaves serve as the primitive material of money but has never used land for that purpose such an idea could only spring up in a bourgeois society already well developed it dates from the last third of the th century and the first attempt to put it in practice on a national scale was made a century afterwards during the french bourgeois revolution in proportion as exchange bursts its local bonds and the value of commodities more and more expands into an embodiment of human labour in the abstract in the same proportion the character of money attaches itself to commodities that are by nature fitted to perform the social function of a universal equivalent those commodities are the precious metals the truth of the proposition that “although gold and silver are not by nature money money is by nature gold and silver” is shown by the fitness of the physical properties of these metals for the functions of money up to this point however we are acquainted only with one function of money namely to serve as the form of manifestation of the value of commodities or as the material in which the magnitudes of their values are socially expressed an adequate form of manifestation of value a fit embodiment of abstract undifferentiated and therefore equal human labour that material alone can be whose every sample exhibits the same uniform qualities on the other hand since the difference between the magnitudes of value is purely quantitative the money commodity must be susceptible of merely quantitative differences must therefore be divisible at will and equally capable of being reunited gold and silver possess these properties by nature the usevalue of the moneycommodity becomes twofold in addition to its special usevalue as a commodity gold for instance serving to stop teeth to form the raw material of articles of luxury c it acquires a formal usevalue originating in its specific social function since all commodities are merely particular equivalents of money the latter being their universal equivalent they with regard to the latter as the universal commodity play the parts of particular commodities we have seen that the moneyform is but the reflex thrown upon one single commodity of the value relations between all the rest that money is a commodity is therefore a new discovery only for those who when they analyse it start from its fully developed shape the act of exchange gives to the commodity converted into money not its value but its specific valueform by confounding these two distinct things some writers have been led to hold that the value of gold and silver is imaginary the fact that money can in certain functions be replaced by mere symbols of itself gave rise to that other mistaken notion that it is itself a mere symbol nevertheless under this error lurked a presentiment that the moneyform of an object is not an inseparable part of that object but is simply the form under which certain social relations manifest themselves in this sense every commodity is a symbol since in so far as it is value it is only the material envelope of the human labour spent upon it but if it be declared that the social characters assumed by objects or the material forms assumed by the social qualities of labour under the régime of a definite mode of production are mere symbols it is in the same breath also declared that these characteristics are arbitrary fictions sanctioned by the socalled universal consent of mankind this suited the mode of explanation in favour during the th century unable to account for the origin of the puzzling forms assumed by social relations between man and man people sought to denude them of their strange appearance by ascribing to them a conventional origin it has already been remarked above that the equivalent form of a commodity does not imply the determination of the magnitude of its value therefore although we may be aware that gold is money and consequently directly exchangeable for all other commodities yet that fact by no means tells how much lbs for instance of gold is worth money like every other commodity cannot express the magnitude of its value except relatively in other commodities this value is determined by the labourtime required for its production and is expressed by the quantity of any other commodity that costs the same amount of labourtime such quantitative determination of its relative value takes place at the source of its production by means of barter when it steps into circulation as money its value is already given in the last decades of the th century it had already been shown that money is a commodity but this step marks only the infancy of the analysis the difficulty lies not in comprehending that money is a commodity but in discovering how why and by what means a commodity becomes money we have already seen from the most elementary expression of value x commodity a y commodity b that the object in which the magnitude of the value of another object is represented appears to have the equivalent form independently of this relation as a social property given to it by nature we followed up this false appearance to its final establishment which is complete so soon as the universal equivalent form becomes identified with the bodily form of a particular commodity and thus crystallised into the moneyform what appears to happen is not that gold becomes money in consequence of all other commodities expressing their values in it but on the contrary that all other commodities universally express their values in gold because it is money the intermediate steps of the process vanish in the result and leave no trace behind commodities find their own value already completely represented without any initiative on their part in another commodity existing in company with them these objects gold and silver just as they come out of the bowels of the earth are forthwith the direct incarnation of all human labour hence the magic of money in the form of society now under consideration the behaviour of men in the social process of production is purely atomic hence their relations to each other in production assume a material character independent of their control and conscious individual action these facts manifest themselves at first by products as a general rule taking the form of commodities we have seen how the progressive development of a society of commodityproducers stamps one privileged commodity with the character of money hence the riddle presented by money is but the riddle presented by commodities only it now strikes us in its most glaring form chapter money or the circulation of commodities section the measure of values throughout this work i assume for the sake of simplicity gold as the moneycommodity the first chief function of money is to supply commodities with the material for the expression of their values or to represent their values as magnitudes of the same denomination qualitatively equal and quantitatively comparable it thus serves as a universal measure of value and only by virtue of this function does gold the equivalent commodity par excellence become money it is not money that renders commodities commensurable just the contrary it is because all commodities as values are realised human labour and therefore commensurable that their values can be measured by one and the same special commodity and the latter be converted into the common measure of their values ie into money money as a measure of value is the phenomenal form that must of necessity be assumed by that measure of value which is immanent in commodities labourtime the expression of the value of a commodity in gold – x commodity a y moneycommodity – is its moneyform or price a single equation such as ton of iron ounces of gold now suffices to express the value of the iron in a socially valid manner there is no longer any need for this equation to figure as a link in the chain of equations that express the values of all other commodities because the equivalent commodity gold now has the character of money the general form of relative value has resumed its original shape of simple or isolated relative value on the other hand the expanded expression of relative value the endless series of equations has now become the form peculiar to the relative value of the moneycommodity the series itself too is now given and has social recognition in the prices of actual commodities we have only to read the quotations of a pricelist backwards to find the magnitude of the value of money expressed in all sorts of commodities but money itself has no price in order to put it on an equal footing with all other commodities in this respect we should be obliged to equate it to itself as its own equivalent the price or moneyform of commodities is like their form of value generally a form quite distinct from their palpable bodily form it is therefore a purely ideal or mental form although invisible the value of iron linen and corn has actual existence in these very articles it is ideally made perceptible by their equality with gold a relation that so to say exists only in their own heads their owner must therefore lend them his tongue or hang a ticket on them before their prices can be communicated to the outside world since the expression of the value of commodities in gold is a merely ideal act we may use for this purpose imaginary or ideal money every trader knows that he is far from having turned his goods into money when he has expressed their value in a price or in imaginary money and that it does not require the least bit of real gold to estimate in that metal millions of pounds’ worth of goods when therefore money serves as a measure of value it is employed only as imaginary or ideal money this circumstance has given rise to the wildest theories but although the money that performs the functions of a measure of value is only ideal money price depends entirely upon the actual substance that is money the value or in other words the quantity of human labour contained in a ton of iron is expressed in imagination by such a quantity of the moneycommodity as contains the same amount of labour as the iron according therefore as the measure of value is gold silver or copper the value of the ton of iron will be expressed by very different prices or will be represented by very different quantities of those metals respectively if therefore two different commodities such as gold and silver are simultaneously measures of value all commodities have two prices – one a goldprice the other a silverprice these exist quietly side by side so long as the ratio of the value of silver to that of gold remains unchanged say at every change in their ratio disturbs the ratio which exists between the goldprices and the silverprices of commodities and thus proves by facts that a double standard of value is inconsistent with the functions of a standard commodities with definite prices present themselves under the form a commodity a x gold b commodity b z gold c commodity c y gold c where a b c represent definite quantities of the commodities a b c and x z y definite quantities of gold the values of these commodities are therefore changed in imagination into so many different quantities of gold hence in spite of the confusing variety of the commodities themselves their values become magnitudes of the same denomination goldmagnitudes they are now capable of being compared with each other and measured and the want becomes technically felt of comparing them with some fixed quantity of gold as a unit measure this unit by subsequent division into aliquot parts becomes itself the standard or scale before they become money gold silver and copper already possess such standard measures in their standards of weight so that for example a pound weight while serving as the unit is on the one hand divisible into ounces and on the other may be combined to make up hundredweights it is owing to this that in all metallic currencies the names given to the standards of money or of price were originally taken from the preexisting names of the standards of weight as measure of value and as standard of price money has two entirely distinct functions to perform it is the measure of value inasmuch as it is the socially recognised incarnation of human labour it is the standard of price inasmuch as it is a fixed weight of metal as the measure of value it serves to convert the values of all the manifold commodities into prices into imaginary quantities of gold as the standard of price it measures those quantities of gold the measure of values measures commodities considered as values the standard of price measures on the contrary quantities of gold by a unit quantity of gold not the value of one quantity of gold by the weight of another in order to make gold a standard of price a certain weight must be fixed upon as the unit in this case as in all cases of measuring quantities of the same denomination the establishment of an unvarying unit of measure is allimportant hence the less the unit is subject to variation so much the better does the standard of price fulfil its office but only in so far as it is itself a product of labour and therefore potentially variable in value can gold serve as a measure of value it is in the first place quite clear that a change in the value of gold does not in any way affect its function as a standard of price no matter how this value varies the proportions between the values of different quantities of the metal remain constant however great the fall in its value ounces of gold still have times the value of ounce and in prices the only thing considered is the relation between different quantities of gold since on the other hand no rise or fall in the value of an ounce of gold can alter its weight no alteration can take place in the weight of its aliquot parts thus gold always renders the same service as an invariable standard of price however much its value may vary in the second place a change in the value of gold does not interfere with its functions as a measure of value the change affects all commodities simultaneously and therefore caeteris paribus leaves their relative values inter se unaltered although those values are now expressed in higher or lower goldprices just as when we estimate the value of any commodity by a definite quantity of the usevalue of some other commodity so in estimating the value of the former in gold we assume nothing more than that the production of a given quantity of gold costs at the given period a given amount of labour as regards the fluctuations of prices generally they are subject to the laws of elementary relative value investigated in a former chapter a general rise in the prices of commodities can result only either from a rise in their values – the value of money remaining constant – or from a fall in the value of money the values of commodities remaining constant on the other hand a general fall in prices can result only either from a fall in the values of commodities – the value of money remaining constant – or from a rise in the value of money the values of commodities remaining constant it therefore by no means follows that a rise in the value of money necessarily implies a proportional fall in the prices of commodities or that a fall in the value of money implies a proportional rise in prices such change of price holds good only in the case of commodities whose value remains constant with those for example whose value rises simultaneously with and proportionally to that of money there is no alteration in price and if their value rise either slower or faster than that of money the fall or rise in their prices will be determined by the difference between the change in their value and that of money and so on let us now go back to the consideration of the priceform by degrees there arises a discrepancy between the current moneynames of the various weights of the precious metal figuring as money and the actual weights which those names originally represented this discrepancy is the result of historical causes among which the chief are – the importation of foreign money into an imperfectly developed community this happened in rome in its early days where gold and silver coins circulated at first as foreign commodities the names of these foreign coins never coincide with those of the indigenous weights as wealth increases the less precious metal is thrust out by the more precious from its place as a measure of value copper by silver silver by gold however much this order of sequence may be in contradiction with poetical chronology the word pound for instance was the moneyname given to an actual pound weight of silver when gold replaced silver as a measure of value the same name was applied according to the ratio between the values of silver and gold to perhaps th of a pound of gold the word pound as a moneyname thus becomes differentiated from the same word as a weightname the debasing of money carried on for centuries by kings and princes to such an extent that of the original weights of the coins nothing in fact remained but the names these historical causes convert the separation of the moneyname from the weightname into an established habit with the community since the standard of money is on the one hand purely conventional and must on the other hand find general acceptance it is in the end regulated by law a given weight of one of the precious metals an ounce of gold for instance becomes officially divided into aliquot parts with legally bestowed names such as pound dollar c these aliquot parts which thenceforth serve as units of money are then subdivided into other aliquot parts with legal names such as shilling penny c but both before and after these divisions are made a definite weight of metal is the standard of metallic money the sole alteration consists in the subdivision and denomination the prices or quantities of gold into which the values of commodities are ideally changed are therefore now expressed in the names of coins or in the legally valid names of the subdivisions of the gold standard hence instead of saying a quarter of wheat is worth an ounce of gold we say it is worth £ s d in this way commodities express by their prices how much they are worth and money serves as money of account whenever it is a question of fixing the value of an article in its moneyform the name of a thing is something distinct from the qualities of that thing i know nothing of a man by knowing that his name is jacob in the same way with regard to money every trace of a valuerelation disappears in the names pound dollar franc ducat c the confusion caused by attributing a hidden meaning to these cabalistic signs is all the greater because these moneynames express both the values of commodities and at the same time aliquot parts of the weight of the metal that is the standard of money on the other hand it is absolutely necessary that value in order that it may be distinguished from the varied bodily forms of commodities should assume this material and unmeaning but at the same time purely social form price is the moneyname of the labour realised in a commodity hence the expression of the equivalence of a commodity with the sum of money constituting its price is a tautology just as in general the expression of the relative value of a commodity is a statement of the equivalence of two commodities but although price being the exponent of the magnitude of a commodity’s value is the exponent of its exchangeratio with money it does not follow that the exponent of this exchangeratio is necessarily the exponent of the magnitude of the commodity’s value suppose two equal quantities of socially necessary labour to be respectively represented by quarter of wheat and £ nearly oz of gold £ is the expression in money of the magnitude of the value of the quarter of wheat or is its price if now circumstances allow of this price being raised to £ or compel it to be reduced to £ then although £ and £ may be too small or too great properly to express the magnitude of the wheat’s value nevertheless they are its prices for they are in the first place the form under which its value appears ie money and in the second place the exponents of its exchangeratio with money if the conditions of production in other words if the productive power of labour remain constant the same amount of social labourtime must both before and after the change in price be expended in the reproduction of a quarter of wheat this circumstance depends neither on the will of the wheat producer nor on that of the owners of other commodities magnitude of value expresses a relation of social production it expresses the connexion that necessarily exists between a certain article and the portion of the total labourtime of society required to produce it as soon as magnitude of value is converted into price the above necessary relation takes the shape of a more or less accidental exchangeratio between a single commodity and another the moneycommodity but this exchangeratio may express either the real magnitude of that commodity’s value or the quantity of gold deviating from that value for which according to circumstances it may be parted with the possibility therefore of quantitative incongruity between price and magnitude of value or the deviation of the former from the latter is inherent in the priceform itself this is no defect but on the contrary admirably adapts the priceform to a mode of production whose inherent laws impose themselves only as the mean of apparently lawless irregularities that compensate one another the priceform however is not only compatible with the possibility of a quantitative incongruity between magnitude of value and price ie between the former and its expression in money but it may also conceal a qualitative inconsistency so much so that although money is nothing but the valueform of commodities price ceases altogether to express value objects that in themselves are no commodities such as conscience honour c are capable of being offered for sale by their holders and of thus acquiring through their price the form of commodities hence an object may have a price without having value the price in that case is imaginary like certain quantities in mathematics on the other hand the imaginary priceform may sometimes conceal either a direct or indirect real valuerelation for instance the price of uncultivated land which is without value because no human labour has been incorporated in it price like relative value in general expresses the value of a commodity eg a ton of iron by stating that a given quantity of the equivalent eg an ounce of gold is directly exchangeable for iron but it by no means states the converse that iron is directly exchangeable for gold in order therefore that a commodity may in practice act effectively as exchangevalue it must quit its bodily shape must transform itself from mere imaginary into real gold although to the commodity such transubstantiation may be more difficult than to the hegelian “concept” the transition from “necessity” to “freedom” or to a lobster the casting of his shell or to saint jerome the putting off of the old adam though a commodity may side by side with its actual form iron for instance take in our imagination the form of gold yet it cannot at one and the same time actually be both iron and gold to fix its price it suffices to equate it to gold in imagination but to enable it to render to its owner the service of a universal equivalent it must be actually replaced by gold if the owner of the iron were to go to the owner of some other commodity offered for exchange and were to refer him to the price of the iron as proof that it was already money he would get the same answer as st peter gave in heaven to dante when the latter recited the creed – “assad bene e trascorsa d’esta moneta gia la lega e’l peso ma dimmi se tu l’hai nella tua borsa” a price therefore implies both that a commodity is exchangeable for money and also that it must be so exchanged on the other hand gold serves as an ideal measure of value only because it has already in the process of exchange established itself as the moneycommodity under the ideal measure of values there lurks the hard cash section the medium of circulation a the metamorphosis of commodities we saw in a former chapter that the exchange of commodities implies contradictory and mutually exclusive conditions the differentiation of commodities into commodities and money does not sweep away these inconsistencies but develops a modus vivendi a form in which they can exist side by side this is generally the way in which real contradictions are reconciled for instance it is a contradiction to depict one body as constantly falling towards another and as at the same time constantly flying away from it the ellipse is a form of motion which while allowing this contradiction to go on at the same time reconciles it in so far as exchange is a process by which commodities are transferred from hands in which they are nonusevalues to hands in which they become usevalues it is a social circulation of matter the product of one form of useful labour replaces that of another when once a commodity has found a restingplace where it can serve as a usevalue it falls out of the sphere of exchange into that of consumption but the former sphere alone interests us at present we have therefore now to consider exchange from a formal point of view to investigate the change of form or metamorphosis of commodities which effectuates the social circulation of matter the comprehension of this change of form is as a rule very imperfect the cause of this imperfection is apart from indistinct notions of value itself that every change of form in a commodity results from the exchange of two commodities an ordinary one and the moneycommodity if we keep in view the material fact alone that a commodity has been exchanged for gold we overlook the very thing that we ought to observe – namely what has happened to the form of the commodity we overlook the facts that gold when a mere commodity is not money and that when other commodities express their prices in gold this gold is but the moneyform of those commodities themselves commodities first of all enter into the process of exchange just as they are the process then differentiates them into commodities and money and thus produces an external opposition corresponding to the internal opposition inherent in them as being at once usevalues and values commodities as usevalues now stand opposed to money as exchangevalue on the other hand both opposing sides are commodities unities of usevalue and value but this unity of differences manifests itself at two opposite poles and at each pole in an opposite way being poles they are as necessarily opposite as they are connected on the one side of the equation we have an ordinary commodity which is in reality a usevalue its value is expressed only ideally in its price by which it is equated to its opponent the gold as to the real embodiment of its value on the other hand the gold in its metallic reality ranks as the embodiment of value as money gold as gold is exchangevalue itself as to its usevalue that has only an ideal existence represented by the series of expressions of relative value in which it stands face to face with all other commodities the sum of whose uses makes up the sum of the various uses of gold these antagonistic forms of commodities are the real forms in which the process of their exchange moves and takes place let us now accompany the owner of some commodity – say our old friend the weaver of linen – to the scene of action the market his yards of linen has a definite price £ he exchanges it for the £ and then like a man of the good old stamp that he is he parts with the £ for a family bible of the same price the linen which in his eyes is a mere commodity a depository of value he alienates in exchange for gold which is the linen’s valueform and this form he again parts with for another commodity the bible which is destined to enter his house as an object of utility and of edification to its inmates the exchange becomes an accomplished fact by two metamorphoses of opposite yet supplementary character – the conversion of the commodity into money and the reconversion of the money into a commodity the two phases of this metamorphosis are both of them distinct transactions of the weaver – selling or the exchange of the commodity for money buying or the exchange of the money for a commodity and the unity of the two acts selling in order to buy the result of the whole transaction as regards the weaver is this that instead of being in possession of the linen he now has the bible instead of his original commodity he now possesses another of the same value but of different utility in like manner he procures his other means of subsistence and means of production from his point of view the whole process effectuates nothing more than the exchange of the product of his labour for the product of some one else’s nothing more than an exchange of products the exchange of commodities is therefore accompanied by the following changes in their form commodity – money – commodity c–––––– m ––––––c the result of the whole process is so far as concerns the objects themselves c – c the exchange of one commodity for another the circulation of materialised social labour when this result is attained the process is at an end c – m first metamorphosis or sale the leap taken by value from the body of the commodity into the body of the gold is as i have elsewhere called it the salto mortale of the commodity if it falls short then although the commodity itself is not harmed its owner decidedly is the social division of labour causes his labour to be as onesided as his wants are manysided this is precisely the reason why the product of his labour serves him solely as exchangevalue but it cannot acquire the properties of a socially recognised universal equivalent except by being converted into money that money however is in some one else’s pocket in order to entice the money out of that pocket our friend’s commodity must above all things be a usevalue to the owner of the money for this it is necessary that the labour expended upon it be of a kind that is socially useful of a kind that constitutes a branch of the social division of labour but division of labour is a system of production which has grown up spontaneously and continues to grow behind the backs of the producers the commodity to be exchanged may possibly be the product of some new kind of labour that pretends to satisfy newly arisen requirements or even to give rise itself to new requirements a particular operation though yesterday perhaps forming one out of the many operations conducted by one producer in creating a given commodity may today separate itself from this connexion may establish itself as an independent branch of labour and send its incomplete product to market as an independent commodity the circumstances may or may not be ripe for such a separation today the product satisfies a social want tomorrow the article may either altogether or partially be superseded by some other appropriate product moreover although our weaver’s labour may be a recognised branch of the social division of labour yet that fact is by no means sufficient to guarantee the utility of his yards of linen if the community’s want of linen and such a want has a limit like every other want should already be saturated by the products of rival weavers our friend’s product is superfluous redundant and consequently useless although people do not look a gifthorse in the mouth our friend does not frequent the market for the purpose of making presents but suppose his product turn out a real usevalue and thereby attracts money the question arises how much will it attract no doubt the answer is already anticipated in the price of the article in the exponent of the magnitude of its value we leave out of consideration here any accidental miscalculation of value by our friend a mistake that is soon rectified in the market we suppose him to have spent on his product only that amount of labourtime that is on an average socially necessary the price then is merely the moneyname of the quantity of social labour realised in his commodity but without the leave and behind the back of our weaver the oldfashioned mode of weaving undergoes a change the labourtime that yesterday was without doubt socially necessary to the production of a yard of linen ceases to be so today a fact which the owner of the money is only too eager to prove from the prices quoted by our friend’s competitors unluckily for him weavers are not few and far between lastly suppose that every piece of linen in the market contains no more labourtime than is socially necessary in spite of this all these pieces taken as a whole may have had superfluous labourtime spent upon them if the market cannot stomach the whole quantity at the normal price of shillings a yard this proves that too great a portion of the total labour of the community has been expended in the form of weaving the effect is the same as if each individual weaver had expended more labourtime upon his particular product than is socially necessary here we may say with the german proverb caught together hung together all the linen in the market counts but as one article of commerce of which each piece is only an aliquot part and as a matter of fact the value also of each single yard is but the materialised form of the same definite and socially fixed quantity of homogeneous human labour we see then commodities are in love with money but “the course of true love never did run smooth” the quantitative division of labour is brought about in exactly the same spontaneous and accidental manner as its qualitative division the owners of commodities therefore find out that the same division of labour that turns them into independent private producers also frees the social process of production and the relations of the individual producers to each other within that process from all dependence on the will of those producers and that the seeming mutual independence of the individuals is supplemented by a system of general and mutual dependence through or by means of the products the division of labour converts the product of labour into a commodity and thereby makes necessary its further conversion into money at the same time it also makes the accomplishment of this transubstantiation quite accidental here however we are only concerned with the phenomenon in its integrity and we therefore assume its progress to be normal moreover if the conversion take place at all that is if the commodity be not absolutely unsaleable its metamorphosis does take place although the price realised may be abnormally above or below the value the seller has his commodity replaced by gold the buyer has his gold replaced by a commodity the fact which here stares us in the face is that a commodity and gold yards of linen and £ have changed hands and places in other words that they have been exchanged but for what is the commodity exchanged for the shape assumed by its own value for the universal equivalent and for what is the gold exchanged for a particular form of its own usevalue why does gold take the form of money face to face with the linen because the linen’s price of £ its denomination in money has already equated the linen to gold in its character of money a commodity strips off its original commodityform on being alienated ie on the instant its usevalue actually attracts the gold that before existed only ideally in its price the realisation of a commodity’s price or of its ideal valueform is therefore at the same time the realisation of the ideal usevalue of money the conversion of a commodity into money is the simultaneous conversion of money into a commodity the apparently single process is in reality a double one from the pole of the commodityowner it is a sale from the opposite pole of the moneyowner it is a purchase in other words a sale is a purchase c–m is also m–c up to this point we have considered men in only one economic capacity that of owners of commodities a capacity in which they appropriate the produce of the labour of others by alienating that of their own labour hence for one commodityowner to meet with another who has money it is necessary either that the product of the labour of the latter person the buyer should be in itself money should be gold the material of which money consists or that his product should already have changed its skin and have stripped off its original form of a useful object in order that it may play the part of money gold must of course enter the market at some point or other this point is to be found at the source of production of the metal at which place gold is bartered as the immediate product of labour for some other product of equal value from that moment it always represents the realised price of some commodity apart from its exchange for other commodities at the source of its production gold in whosesoever hands it may be is the transformed shape of some commodity alienated by its owner it is the product of a sale or of the first metamorphosis c–m gold as we saw became ideal money or a measure of values in consequence of all commodities measuring their values by it and thus contrasting it ideally with their natural shape as useful objects and making it the shape of their value it became real money by the general alienation of commodities by actually changing places with their natural forms as useful objects and thus becoming in reality the embodiment of their values when they assume this moneyshape commodities strip off every trace of their natural usevalue and of the particular kind of labour to which they owe their creation in order to transform themselves into the uniform socially recognised incarnation of homogeneous human labour we cannot tell from the mere look of a piece of money for what particular commodity it has been exchanged under their moneyform all commodities look alike hence money may be dirt although dirt is not money we will assume that the two gold pieces in consideration of which our weaver has parted with his linen are the metamorphosed shape of a quarter of wheat the sale of the linen c–m is at the same time its purchase m–c but the sale is the first act of a process that ends with a transaction of an opposite nature namely the purchase of a bible the purchase of the linen on the other hand ends a movement that began with a transaction of an opposite nature namely with the sale of the wheat c–m linen–money which is the first phase of c–m–c linen–money–bible is also m–c money–linen the last phase of another movement c–m–c wheat–money–linen the first metamorphosis of one commodity its transformation from a commodity into money is therefore also invariably the second metamorphosis of some other commodity the retransformation of the latter from money into a commodity m–c or purchase the second and concluding metamorphosis of a commodity because money is the metamorphosed shape of all other commodities the result of their general alienation for this reason it is alienable itself without restriction or condition it reads all prices backwards and thus so to say depicts itself in the bodies of all other commodities which offer to it the material for the realisation of its own usevalue at the same time the prices wooing glances cast at money by commodities define the limits of its convertibility by pointing to its quantity since every commodity on becoming money disappears as a commodity it is impossible to tell from the money itself how it got into the hands of its possessor or what article has been changed into it non olet from whatever source it may come representing on the one hand a sold commodity it represents on the other a commodity to be bought m–c a purchase is at the same time c–m a sale the concluding metamorphosis of one commodity is the first metamorphosis of another with regard to our weaver the life of his commodity ends with the bible into which he has reconverted his £ but suppose the seller of the bible turns the £ set free by the weaver into brandy m–c the concluding phase of c–m–c linen–money–bible is also c–m the first phase of c–m–c bible–money–brandy the producer of a particular commodity has that one article alone to offer this he sells very often in large quantities but his many and various wants compel him to split up the price realised the sum of money set free into numerous purchases hence a sale leads to many purchases of various articles the concluding metamorphosis of a commodity thus constitutes an aggregation of first metamorphoses of various other commodities if we now consider the completed metamorphosis of a commodity as a whole it appears in the first place that it is made up of two opposite and complementary movements c–m and m–c these two antithetical transmutations of a commodity are brought about by two antithetical social acts on the part of the owner and these acts in their turn stamp the character of the economic parts played by him as the person who makes a sale he is a seller as the person who makes a purchase he is a buyer but just as upon every such transmutation of a commodity its two forms commodityform and moneyform exist simultaneously but at opposite poles so every seller has a buyer opposed to him and every buyer a seller while one particular commodity is going through its two transmutations in succession from a commodity into money and from money into another commodity the owner of the commodity changes in succession his part from that of seller to that of buyer these characters of seller and buyer are therefore not permanent but attach themselves in turns to the various persons engaged in the circulation of commodities the complete metamorphosis of a commodity in its simplest form implies four extremes and three dramatic personae first a commodity comes face to face with money the latter is the form taken by the value of the former and exists in all its hard reality in the pocket of the buyer a commodityowner is thus brought into contact with a possessor of money so soon now as the commodity has been changed into money the money becomes its transient equivalentform the usevalue of which equivalentform is to be found in the bodies of other commodities money the final term of the first transmutation is at the same time the startingpoint for the second the person who is a seller in the first transaction thus becomes a buyer in the second in which a third commodityowner appears on the scene as a seller the two phases each inverse to the other that make up the metamorphosis of a commodity constitute together a circular movement a circuit commodityform stripping off of this form and return to the commodityform no doubt the commodity appears here under two different aspects at the startingpoint it is not a usevalue to its owner at the finishing point it is so too the money appears in the first phase as a solid crystal of value a crystal into which the commodity eagerly solidifies and in the second dissolves into the mere transient equivalentform destined to be replaced by a usevalue the two metamorphoses constituting the circuit are at the same time two inverse partial metamorphoses of two other commodities one and the same commodity the linen opens the series of its own metamorphoses and completes the metamorphosis of another the wheat in the first phase or sale the linen plays these two parts in its own person but then changed into gold it completes its own second and final metamorphosis and helps at the same time to accomplish the first metamorphosis of a third commodity hence the circuit made by one commodity in the course of its metamorphoses is inextricably mixed up with the circuits of other commodities the total of all the different circuits constitutes the circulation of commodities the circulation of commodities differs from the direct exchange of products barter not only in form but in substance only consider the course of events the weaver has as a matter of fact exchanged his linen for a bible his own commodity for that of some one else but this is true only so far as he himself is concerned the seller of the bible who prefers something to warm his inside no more thought of exchanging his bible for linen than our weaver knew that wheat had been exchanged for his linen b’s commodity replaces that of a but a and b do not mutually exchange those commodities it may of course happen that a and b make simultaneous purchases the one from the other but such exceptional transactions are by no means the necessary result of the general conditions of the circulation of commodities we see here on the one hand how the exchange of commodities breaks through all local and personal bounds inseparable from direct barter and develops the circulation of the products of social labour and on the other hand how it develops a whole network of social relations spontaneous in their growth and entirely beyond the control of the actors it is only because the farmer has sold his wheat that the weaver is enabled to sell his linen only because the weaver has sold his linen that our hotspur is enabled to sell his bible and only because the latter has sold the water of everlasting life that the distiller is enabled to sell his eaudevie and so on the process of circulation therefore does not like direct barter of products become extinguished upon the usevalues changing places and hands the money does not vanish on dropping out of the circuit of the metamorphosis of a given commodity it is constantly being precipitated into new places in the arena of circulation vacated by other commodities in the complete metamorphosis of the linen for example linen – money – bible the linen first falls out of circulation and money steps into its place then the bible falls out of circulation and again money takes its place when one commodity replaces another the moneycommodity always sticks to the hands of some third person circulation sweats money from every pore nothing can be more childish than the dogma that because every sale is a purchase and every purchase a sale therefore the circulation of commodities necessarily implies an equilibrium of sales and purchases if this means that the number of actual sales is equal to the number of purchases it is mere tautology but its real purport is to prove that every seller brings his buyer to market with him nothing of the kind the sale and the purchase constitute one identical act an exchange between a commodityowner and an owner of money between two persons as opposed to each other as the two poles of a magnet they form two distinct acts of polar and opposite characters when performed by one single person hence the identity of sale and purchase implies that the commodity is useless if on being thrown into the alchemistical retort of circulation it does not come out again in the shape of money if in other words it cannot be sold by its owner and therefore be bought by the owner of the money that identity further implies that the exchange if it does take place constitutes a period of rest an interval long or short in the life of the commodity since the first metamorphosis of a commodity is at once a sale and a purchase it is also an independent process in itself the purchaser has the commodity the seller has the money ie a commodity ready to go into circulation at any time no one can sell unless some one else purchases but no one is forthwith bound to purchase because he has just sold circulation bursts through all restrictions as to time place and individuals imposed by direct barter and this it effects by splitting up into the antithesis of a sale and a purchase the direct identity that in barter does exist between the alienation of one’s own and the acquisition of some other man’s product to say that these two independent and antithetical acts have an intrinsic unity are essentially one is the same as to say that this intrinsic oneness expresses itself in an external antithesis if the interval in time between the two complementary phases of the complete metamorphosis of a commodity become too great if the split between the sale and the purchase become too pronounced the intimate connexion between them their oneness asserts itself by producing – a crisis the antithesis usevalue and value the contradictions that private labour is bound to manifest itself as direct social labour that a particularised concrete kind of labour has to pass for abstract human labour the contradiction between the personification of objects and the representation of persons by things all these antitheses and contradictions which are immanent in commodities assert themselves and develop their modes of motion in the antithetical phases of the metamorphosis of a commodity these modes therefore imply the possibility and no more than the possibility of crises the conversion of this mere possibility into a reality is the result of a long series of relations that from our present standpoint of simple circulation have as yet no existence b the currency of money the change of form c–m–c by which the circulation of the material products of labour is brought about requires that a given value in the shape of a commodity shall begin the process and shall also in the shape of a commodity end it the movement of the commodity is therefore a circuit on the other hand the form of this movement precludes a circuit from being made by the money the result is not the return of the money but its continued removal further and further away from its startingpoint so long as the seller sticks fast to his money which is the transformed shape of his commodity that commodity is still in the first phase of its metamorphosis and has completed only half its course but so soon as he completes the process so soon as he supplements his sale by a purchase the money again leaves the hands of its possessor it is true that if the weaver after buying the bible sell more linen money comes back into his hands but this return is not owing to the circulation of the first yards of linen that circulation resulted in the money getting into the hands of the seller of the bible the return of money into the hands of the weaver is brought about only by the renewal or repetition of the process of circulation with a fresh commodity which renewed process ends with the same result as its predecessor did hence the movement directly imparted to money by the circulation of commodities takes the form of a constant motion away from its startingpoint of a course from the hands of one commodityowner into those of another this course constitutes its currency cours de la monnaie the currency of money is the constant and monotonous repetition of the same process the commodity is always in the hands of the seller the money as a means of purchase always in the hands of the buyer and money serves as a means of purchase by realising the price of the commodity this realisation transfers the commodity from the seller to the buyer and removes the money from the hands of the buyer into those of the seller where it again goes through the same process with another commodity that this onesided character of the money’s motion arises out of the twosided character of the commodity’s motion is a circumstance that is veiled over the very nature of the circulation of commodities begets the opposite appearance the first metamorphosis of a commodity is visibly not only the money’s movement but also that of the commodity itself in the second metamorphosis on the contrary the movement appears to us as the movement of the money alone in the first phase of its circulation the commodity changes place with the money thereupon the commodity under its aspect of a useful object falls out of circulation into consumption in its stead we have its valueshape – the money it then goes through the second phase of its circulation not under its own natural shape but under the shape of money the continuity of the movement is therefore kept up by the money alone and the same movement that as regards the commodity consists of two processes of an antithetical character is when considered as the movement of the money always one and the same process a continued change of places with ever fresh commodities hence the result brought about by the circulation of commodities namely the replacing of one commodity by another takes the appearance of having been effected not by means of the change of form of the commodities but rather by the money acting as a medium of circulation by an action that circulates commodities to all appearance motionless in themselves and transfers them from hands in which they are nonusevalues to hands in which they are usevalues and that in a direction constantly opposed to the direction of the money the latter is continually withdrawing commodities from circulation and stepping into their places and in thus way continually moving further and further from its startingpoint hence although the movement of the money is merely the expression of the circulation of commodities yet the contrary appears to be the actual fact and the circulation of commodities seems to be the result of the movement of the money again money functions as a means of circulation only because in it the values of commodities have independent reality hence its movement as the medium of circulation is in fact merely the movement of commodities while changing their forms this fact must therefore make itself plainly visible in the currency of money thus the linen for instance first of all changes its commodityform into its moneyform the second term of its first metamorphosis c–m the money form then becomes the first term of its final metamorphosis m–c its reconversion into the bible but each of these two changes of form is accomplished by an exchange between commodity and money by their reciprocal displacement the same pieces of coin come into the seller’s hand as the alienated form of the commodity and leave it as the absolutely alienable form of the commodity they are displaced twice the first metamorphosis of the linen puts these coins into the weaver’s pocket the second draws them out of it the two inverse changes undergone by the same commodity are reflected in the displacement twice repeated but in opposite directions of the same pieces of coin if on the contrary only one phase of the metamorphosis is gone through if there are only sales or only purchases then a given piece of money changes its place only once its second change of place always expresses the second metamorphosis of the commodity its reconversion from money the frequent repetition of the displacement of the same coins reflects not only the series of metamorphoses that a single commodity has gone through but also the intertwining of the innumerable metamorphoses in the world of commodities in general it is a matter of course that all this is applicable to the simple circulation of commodities alone the only form that we are now considering every commodity when it first steps into circulation and undergoes its first change of form does so only to fall out of circulation again and to be replaced by other commodities money on the contrary as the medium of circulation keeps continually within the sphere of circulation and moves about in it the question therefore arises how much money this sphere constantly absorbs in a given country there take place every day at the same time but in different localities numerous onesided metamorphoses of commodities or in other words numerous sales and numerous purchases the commodities are equated beforehand in imagination by their prices to definite quantities of money and since in the form of circulation now under consideration money and commodities always come bodily face to face one at the positive pole of purchase the other at the negative pole of sale it is clear that the amount of the means of circulation required is determined beforehand by the sum of the prices of all these commodities as a matter of fact the money in reality represents the quantity or sum of gold ideally expressed beforehand by the sum of the prices of the commodities the equality of these two sums is therefore selfevident we know however that the values of commodities remaining constant their prices vary with the value of gold the material of money rising in proportion as it falls and falling in proportion as it rises now if in consequence of such a rise or fall in the value of gold the sum of the prices of commodities fall or rise the quantity of money in currency must fall or rise to the same extent the change in the quantity of the circulating medium is in this case it is true caused by the money itself yet not in virtue of its function as a medium of circulation but of its function as a measure of value first the price of the commodities varies inversely as the value of the money and then the quantity of the medium of circulation varies directly as the price of the commodities exactly the same thing would happen if for instance instead of the value of gold falling gold were replaced by silver as the measure of value or if instead of the value of silver rising gold were to thrust silver out from being the measure of value in the one case more silver would be current than gold was before in the other case less gold would be current than silver was before in each case the value of the material of money ie the value of the commodity that serves as the measure of value would have undergone a change and therefore so too would the prices of commodities which express their values in money and so too would the quantity of money current whose function it is to realise those prices we have already seen that the sphere of circulation has an opening through which gold or the material of money generally enters into it as a commodity with a given value hence when money enters on its functions as a measure of value when it expresses prices its value is already determined if now its value fall this fact is first evidenced by a change in the prices of those commodities that are directly bartered for the precious metals at the sources of their production the greater part of all other commodities especially in the imperfectly developed stages of civil society will continue for a long time to be estimated by the former antiquated and illusory value of the measure of value nevertheless one commodity infects another through their common valuerelation so that their prices expressed in gold or in silver gradually settle down into the proportions determined by their comparative values until finally the values of all commodities are estimated in terms of the new value of the metal that constitutes money this process is accompanied by the continued increase in the quantity of the precious metals an increase caused by their streaming in to replace the articles directly bartered for them at their sources of production in proportion therefore as commodities in general acquire their true prices in proportion as their values become estimated according to the fallen value of the precious metal in the same proportion the quantity of that metal necessary for realising those new prices is provided beforehand a onesided observation of the results that followed upon the discovery of fresh supplies of gold and silver led some economists in the th and particularly in the th century to the false conclusion that the prices of commodities had gone up in consequence of the increased quantity of gold and silver serving as means of circulation henceforth we shall consider the value of gold to be given as in fact it is momentarily whenever we estimate the price of a commodity on this supposition then the quantity of the medium of circulation is determined by the sum of the prices that have to be realised if now we further suppose the price of each commodity to be given the sum of the prices clearly depends on the mass of commodities in circulation it requires but little racking of brains to comprehend that if one quarter of wheat costs £ quarters will cost £ quarters £ and so on that consequently the quantity of money that changes place with the wheat when sold must increase with the quantity of that wheat if the mass of commodities remain constant the quantity of circulating money varies with the fluctuations in the prices of those commodities it increases and diminishes because the sum of the prices increases or diminishes in consequence of the change of price to produce this effect it is by no means requisite that the prices of all commodities should rise or fall simultaneously a rise or a fall in the prices of a number of leading articles is sufficient in the one case to increase in the other to diminish the sum of the prices of all commodities and therefore to put more or less money in circulation whether the change in the price correspond to an actual change of value in the commodities or whether it be the result of mere fluctuations in marketprices the effect on the quantity of the medium of circulation remains the same suppose the following articles to be sold or partially metamorphosed simultaneously in different localities say one quarter of wheat yards of linen one bible and gallons of brandy if the price of each article be £ and the sum of the prices to be realised be consequently £ it follows that £ in money must go into circulation if on the other hand these same articles are links in the following chain of metamorphoses quarter of wheat – £ – yards of linen – £ – bible – £ – gallons of brandy – £ a chain that is already well known to us in that case the £ cause the different commodities to circulate one after the other and after realising their prices successively and therefore the sum of those prices £ they come to rest at last in the pocket of the distiller the £ thus make four moves this repeated change of place of the same pieces of money corresponds to the double change in form of the commodities to their motion in opposite directions through two stages of circulation and to the interlacing of the metamorphoses of different commodities these antithetic and complementary phases of which the process of metamorphosis consists are gone through not simultaneously but successively time is therefore required for the completion of the series hence the velocity of the currency of money is measured by the number of moves made by a given piece of money in a given time suppose the circulation of the articles takes a day the sum of the prices to be realised in the day is £ the number of moves of the two pieces of money is four and the quantity of money circulating is £ hence for a given interval of time during the process of circulation we have the following relation the quantity of money functioning as the circulating medium is equal to the sum of the prices of the commodities divided by the number of moves made by coins of the same denomination this law holds generally the total circulation of commodities in a given country during a given period is made up on the one hand of numerous isolated and simultaneous partial metamorphoses sales which are at the same time purchases in which each coin changes its place only once or makes only one move on the other hand of numerous distinct series of metamorphoses partly running side by side and partly coalescing with each other in each of which series each coin makes a number of moves the number being greater or less according to circumstances the total number of moves made by all the circulating coins of one denomination being given we can arrive at the average number of moves made by a single coin of that denomination or at the average velocity of the currency of money the quantity of money thrown into the circulation at the beginning of each day is of course determined by the sum of the prices of all the commodities circulating simultaneously side by side but once in circulation coins are so to say made responsible for one another if the one increase its velocity the other either retards its own or altogether falls out of circulation for the circulation can absorb only such a quantity of gold as when multiplied by the mean number of moves made by one single coin or element is equal to the sum of the prices to be realised hence if the number of moves made by the separate pieces increase the total number of those pieces in circulation diminishes if the number of the moves diminish the total number of pieces increases since the quantity of money capable of being absorbed by the circulation is given for a given mean velocity of currency all that is necessary in order to abstract a given number of sovereigns from the circulation is to throw the same number of onepound notes into it a trick well known to all bankers just as the currency of money generally considered is but a reflex of the circulation of commodities or of the antithetical metamorphoses they undergo so too the velocity of that currency reflects the rapidity with which commodities change their forms the continued interlacing of one series of metamorphoses with another the hurried social interchange of matter the rapid disappearance of commodities from the sphere of circulation and the equally rapid substitution of fresh ones in their places hence in the velocity of the currency we have the fluent unity of the antithetical and complementary phases the unity of the conversion of the useful aspect of commodities into their valueaspect and their reconversion from the latter aspect to the former or the unity of the two processes of sale and purchase on the other hand the retardation of the currency reflects the separation of these two processes into isolated antithetical phases reflects the stagnation in the change of form and therefore in the social interchange of matter the circulation itself of course gives no clue to the origin of this stagnation it merely puts in evidence the phenomenon itself the general public who simultaneously with the retardation of the currency see money appear and disappear less frequently at the periphery of circulation naturally attribute this retardation to a quantitative deficiency in the circulating medium the total quantity of money functioning during a given period as the circulating medium is determined on the one hand by the sum of the prices of the circulating commodities and on the other hand by the rapidity with which the antithetical phases of the metamorphoses follow one another on this rapidity depends what proportion of the sum of the prices can on the average be realised by each single coin but the sum of the prices of the circulating commodities depends on the quantity as well as on the prices of the commodities these three factors however state of prices quantity of circulating commodities and velocity of moneycurrency are all variable hence the sum of the prices to be realised and consequently the quantity of the circulating medium depending on that sum will vary with the numerous variations of these three factors in combination of these variations we shall consider those alone that have been the most important in the history of prices while prices remain constant the quantity of the circulating medium may increase owing to the number of circulating commodities increasing or to the velocity of currency decreasing or to a combination of the two on the other hand the quantity of the circulating medium may decrease with a decreasing number of commodities or with an increasing rapidity of their circulation with a general rise in the prices of commodities the quantity of the circulating medium will remain constant provided the number of commodities in circulation decrease proportionally to the increase in their prices or provided the velocity of currency increase at the same rate as prices rise the number of commodities in circulation remaining constant the quantity of the circulating medium may decrease owing to the number of commodities decreasing more rapidly or to the velocity of currency increasing more rapidly than prices rise with a general fall in the prices of commodities the quantity of the circulating medium will remain constant provided the number of commodities increase proportionally to their fall in price or provided the velocity of currency decrease in the same proportion the quantity of the circulating medium will increase provided the number of commodities increase quicker or the rapidity of circulation decrease quicker than the prices fall the variations of the different factors may mutually compensate each other so that notwithstanding their continued instability the sum of the prices to be realised and the quantity of money in circulation remain constant consequently we find especially if we take long periods into consideration that the deviations from the average level of the quantity of money current in any country are much smaller than we should at first sight expect apart of course from excessive perturbations periodically arising from industrial and commercial crises or less frequently from fluctuations in the value of money the law that the quantity of the circulating medium is determined by the sum of the prices of the commodities circulating and the average velocity of currency may also be stated as follows given the sum of the values of commodities and the average rapidity of their metamorphoses the quantity of precious metal current as money depends on the value of that precious metal the erroneous opinion that it is on the contrary prices that are determined by the quantity of the circulating medium and that the latter depends on the quantity of the precious metals in a country this opinion was based by those who first held it on the absurd hypothesis that commodities are without a price and money without a value when they first enter into circulation and that once in the circulation an aliquot part of the medley of commodities is exchanged for an aliquot part of the heap of precious metals c coin and symbols of value that money takes the shape of coin springs from its function as the circulating medium the weight of gold represented in imagination by the prices or moneynames of commodities must confront those commodities within the circulation in the shape of coins or pieces of gold of a given denomination coining like the establishment of a standard of prices is the business of the state the different national uniforms worn at home by gold and silver as coins and doffed again in the market of the world indicate the separation between the internal or national spheres of the circulation of commodities and their universal sphere the only difference therefore between coin and bullion is one of shape and gold can at any time pass from one form to the other but no sooner does coin leave the mint than it immediately finds itself on the highroad to the melting pot during their currency coins wear away some more others less name and substance nominal weight and real weight begin their process of separation coins of the same denomination become different in value because they are different in weight the weight of gold fixed upon as the standard of prices deviates from the weight that serves as the circulating medium and the latter thereby ceases any longer to be a real equivalent of the commodities whose prices it realises the history of coinage during the middle ages and down into the th century records the ever renewed confusion arising from this cause the natural tendency of circulation to convert coins into a mere semblance of what they profess to be into a symbol of the weight of metal they are officially supposed to contain is recognised by modern legislation which fixes the loss of weight sufficient to demonetise a gold coin or to make it no longer legal tender the fact that the currency of coins itself effects a separation between their nominal and their real weight creating a distinction between them as mere pieces of metal on the one hand and as coins with a definite function on the other – this fact implies the latent possibility of replacing metallic coins by tokens of some other material by symbols serving the same purposes as coins the practical difficulties in the way of coining extremely minute quantities of gold or silver and the circumstance that at first the less precious metal is used as a measure of value instead of themore precious copper instead of silver silver instead of gold and that the less precious circulates as money until dethroned by the more precious – all these facts explain the parts historically played by silver and copper tokens as substitutes for gold coins silver and copper tokens take the place of gold in those regions of the circulation where coins pass from hand to hand most rapidly and are subject to the maximum amount of wear and tear this occurs where sales and purchases on a very small scale are continually happening in order to prevent these satellites from establishing themselves permanently in the place of gold positive enactments determine the extent to which they must be compulsorily received as payment instead of gold the particular tracks pursued by the different species of coin in currency run naturally into each other the tokens keep company with gold to pay fractional parts of the smallest gold coin gold is on the one hand constantly pouring into retail circulation and on the other hand is as constantly being thrown out again by being changed into tokens the weight of metal in the silver and copper tokens is arbitrarily fixed by law when in currency they wear away even more rapidly than gold coins hence their functions are totally independent of their weight and consequently of all value the function of gold as coin becomes completely independent of the metallic value of that gold therefore things that are relatively without value such as paper notes can serve as coins in its place this purely symbolic character is to a certain extent masked in metal tokens in paper money it stands out plainly in fact ce n’est que le premier pas qui coûte we allude here only to inconvertible paper money issued by the state and having compulsory circulation it has its immediate origin in the metallic currency money based upon credit implies on the other hand conditions which from our standpoint of the simple circulation of commodities are as yet totally unknown to us but we may affirm this much that just as true paper money takes its rise in the function of money as the circulating medium so money based upon credit takes root spontaneously in the function of money as the means of payment the state puts in circulation bits of paper on which their various denominations say £ £ c are printed in so far as they actually take the place of gold to the same amount their movement is subject to the laws that regulate the currency of money itself a law peculiar to the circulation of paper money can spring up only from the proportion in which that paper money represents gold such a law exists stated simply it is as follows the issue of paper money must not exceed in amount the gold or silver as the case may be which would actually circulate if not replaced by symbols now the quantity of gold which the circulation can absorb constantly fluctuates about a given level still the mass of the circulating medium in a given country never sinks below a certain minimum easily ascertained by actual experience the fact that this minimum mass continually undergoes changes in its constituent parts or that the pieces of gold of which it consists are being constantly replaced by fresh ones causes of course no change either in its amount or in the continuity of its circulation it can therefore be replaced by paper symbols if on the other hand all the conduits of circulation were today filled with paper money to the full extent of their capacity for absorbing money they might tomorrow be overflowing in consequence of a fluctuation in the circulation of commodities there would no longer be any standard if the paper money exceed its proper limit which is the amount in gold coins of the like denomination that can actually be current it would apart from the danger of falling into general disrepute represent only that quantity of gold which in accordance with the laws of the circulation of commodities is required and is alone capable of being represented by paper if the quantity of paper money issued be double what it ought to be then as a matter of fact £ would be the moneyname not of of an ounce but of of an ounce of gold the effect would be the same as if an alteration had taken place in the function of gold as a standard of prices those values that were previously expressed by the price of £ would now be expressed by the price of £ paper money is a token representing gold or money the relation between it and the values of commodities is this that the latter are ideally expressed in the same quantities of gold that are symbolically represented by the paper only in so far as paper money represents gold which like all other commodities has value is it a symbol of value finally some one may ask why gold is capable of being replaced by tokens that have no value but as we have already seen it is capable of being so replaced only in so far as it functions exclusively as coin or as the circulating medium and as nothing else now money has other functions besides this one and the isolated function of serving as the mere circulating medium is not necessarily the only one attached to gold coin although this is the case with those abraded coins that continue to circulate each piece of money is a mere coin or means of circulation only so long as it actually circulates but this is just the case with that minimum mass of gold which is capable of being replaced by paper money that mass remains constantly within the sphere of circulation continually functions as a circulating medium and exists exclusively for that purpose its movement therefore represents nothing but the continued alternation of the inverse phases of the metamorphosis c–m–c phases in which commodities confront their valueforms only to disappear again immediately the independent existence of the exchangevalue of a commodity is here a transient apparition by means of which the commodity is immediately replaced by another commodity hence in this process which continually makes money pass from hand to hand the mere symbolical existence of money suffices its functional existence absorbs so to say its material existence being a transient and objective reflex of the prices of commodities it serves only as a symbol of itself and is therefore capable of being replaced by a token one thing is however requisite this token must have an objective social validity of its own and this the paper symbol acquires by its forced currency this compulsory action of the state can take effect only within that inner sphere of circulation which is coterminous with the territories of the community but it is also only within that sphere that money completely responds to its function of being the circulating medium or becomes coin section money the commodity that functions as a measure of value and either in its own person or by a representative as the medium of circulation is money gold or silver is therefore money it functions as money on the one hand when it has to be present in its own golden person it is then the moneycommodity neither merely ideal as in its function of a measure of value nor capable of being represented as in its function of circulating medium on the other hand it also functions as money when by virtue of its function whether that function be performed in person or by representative it congeals into the sole form of value the only adequate form of existence of exchangevalue in opposition to usevalue represented by all other commodities a hoarding the continual movement in circuits of the two antithetical metamorphoses of commodities or the never ceasing alternation of sale and purchase is reflected in the restless currency of money or in the function that money performs of a perpetuum mobile of circulation but so soon as the series of metamorphoses is interrupted so soon as sales are not supplemented by subsequent purchases money ceases to be mobilised it is transformed as boisguillebert says from “meuble” into “immeuble” from movable into immovable from coin into money with the very earliest development of the circulation of commodities there is also developed the necessity and the passionate desire to hold fast the product of the first metamorphosis this product is the transformed shape of the commodity or its goldchrysalis commodities are thus sold not for the purpose of buying others but in order to replace their commodityform by their moneyform from being the mere means of effecting the circulation of commodities this change of form becomes the end and aim the changed form of the commodity is thus prevented from functioning as its unconditionally alienable form or as its merely transient moneyform the money becomes petrified into a hoard and the seller becomes a hoarder of money in the early stages of the circulation of commodities it is the surplus usevalues alone that are converted into money gold and silver thus become of themselves social expressions for superfluity or wealth this naive form of hoarding becomes perpetuated in those communities in which the traditional mode of production is carried on for the supply of a fixed and limited circle of home wants it is thus with the people of asia and particularly of the east indies vanderlint who fancies that the prices of commodities in a country are determined by the quantity of gold and silver to be found in it asks himself why indian commodities are so cheap answer because the hindus bury their money from to he remarks they buried millions of pounds sterling of silver which originally came from america to europe in the years from to england exported to india and china £ in silver which had been received in exchange for australian gold most of the silver exported to china makes its way to india as the production of commodities further develops every producer of commodities is compelled to make sure of the nexus rerum or the social pledge his wants are constantly making themselves felt and necessitate the continual purchase of other people’s commodities while the production and sale of his own goods require time and depend upon circumstances in order then to be able to buy without selling he must have sold previously without buying this operation conducted on a general scale appears to imply a contradiction but the precious metals at the sources of their production are directly exchanged for other commodities and here we have sales by the owners of commodities without purchases by the owners of gold or silver and subsequent sales by other producers unfollowed by purchases merely bring about the distribution of the newly produced precious metals among all the owners of commodities in this way all along the line of exchange hoards of gold and silver of varied extent are accumulated with the possibility of holding and storing up exchangevalue in the shape of a particular commodity arises also the greed for gold along with the extension of circulation increases the power of money that absolutely social form of wealth ever ready for use “gold is a wonderful thing whoever possesses it is lord of all he wants by means of gold one can even get souls into paradise” columbus in his letter from jamaica since gold does not disclose what has been transformed into it everything commodity or not is convertible into gold everything becomes saleable and buyable the circulation becomes the great social retort into which everything is thrown to come out again as a goldcrystal not even are the bones of saints and still less are more delicate res sacrosanctae extra commercium hominum able to withstand this alchemy just as every qualitative difference between commodities is extinguished in money so money on its side like the radical leveller that it is does away with all distinctions a but money itself is a commodity an external object capable of becoming the private property of any individual thus social power becomes the private power of private persons the ancients therefore denounced money as subversive of the economic and moral order of things b modern society which soon after its birth pulled plutus by the hair of his head from the bowels of the earth greets gold as its holy grail as the glittering incarnation of the very principle of its own life a commodity in its capacity of a usevalue satisfies a particular want and is a particular element of material wealth but the value of a commodity measures the degree of its attraction for all other elements of material wealth and therefore measures the social wealth of its owner to a barbarian owner of commodities and even to a westeuropean peasant value is the same as valueform and therefore to him the increase in his hoard of gold and silver is an increase in value it is true that the value of money varies at one time in consequence of a variation in its own value at another in consequence of a change in the values of commodities but this on the one hand does not prevent ounces of gold from still containing more value than ounces nor on the other hand does it hinder the actual metallic form of this article from continuing to be the universal equivalent form of all other commodities and the immediate social incarnation of all human labour the desire after hoarding is in its very nature unsatiable in its qualitative aspect or formally considered money has no bounds to its efficacy ie it is the universal representative of material wealth because it is directly convertible into any other commodity but at the same time every actual sum of money is limited in amount and therefore as a means of purchasing has only a limited efficacy this antagonism between the quantitative limits of money and its qualitative boundlessness continually acts as a spur to the hoarder in his sisyphuslike labour of accumulating it is with him as it is with a conqueror who sees in every new country annexed only a new boundary in order that gold may be held as money and made to form a hoard it must be prevented from circulating or from transforming itself into a means of enjoyment the hoarder therefore makes a sacrifice of the lusts of the flesh to his gold fetish he acts in earnest up to the gospel of abstention on the other hand he can withdraw from circulation no more than what he has thrown into it in the shape of commodities the more he produces the more he is able to sell hard work saving and avarice are therefore his three cardinal virtues and to sell much and buy little the sum of his political economy by the side of the gross form of a hoard we find also its aesthetic form in the possession of gold and silver articles this grows with the wealth of civil society “soyons riches ou paraissons riches” diderot in this way there is created on the one hand a constantly extending market for gold and silver unconnected with their functions as money and on the other hand a latent source of supply to which recourse is had principally in times of crisis and social disturbance hoarding serves various purposes in the economy of the metallic circulation its first function arises out of the conditions to which the currency of gold and silver coins is subject we have seen how along with the continual fluctuations in the extent and rapidity of the circulation of commodities and in their prices the quantity of money current unceasingly ebbs and flows this mass must therefore be capable of expansion and contraction at one time money must be attracted in order to act as circulating coin at another circulating coin must be repelled in order to act again as more or less stagnant money in order that the mass of money actually current may constantly saturate the absorbing power of the circulation it is necessary that the quantity of gold and silver in a country be greater than the quantity required to function as coin this condition is fulfilled by money taking the form of hoards these reserves serve as conduits for the supply or withdrawal of money to or from the circulation which in this way never overflows its banks b means of payment in the simple form of the circulation of commodities hitherto considered we found a given value always presented to us in a double shape as a commodity at one pole as money at the opposite pole the owners of commodities came therefore into contact as the respective representatives of what were already equivalents but with the development of circulation conditions arise under which the alienation of commodities becomes separated by an interval of time from the realisation of their prices it will be sufficient to indicate the most simple of these conditions one sort of article requires a longer another a shorter time for its production again the production of different commodities depends on different seasons of the year one sort of commodity may be born on its own market place another has to make a long journey to market commodityowner no may therefore be ready to sell before no is ready to buy when the same transactions are continually repeated between the same persons the conditions of sale are regulated in accordance with the conditions of production on the other hand the use of a given commodity of a house for instance is sold in common parlance let for a definite period here it is only at the end of the term that the buyer has actually received the usevalue of the commodity he therefore buys it before he pays for it the vendor sells an existing commodity the purchaser buys as the mere representative of money or rather of future money the vendor becomes a creditor the purchaser becomes a debtor since the metamorphosis of commodities or the development of their valueform appears here under a new aspect money also acquires a fresh function it becomes the means of payment the character of creditor or of debtor results here from the simple circulation the change in the form of that circulation stamps buyer and seller with this new die at first therefore these new parts are just as transient and alternating as those of seller and buyer and are in turns played by the same actors but the opposition is not nearly so pleasant and is far more capable of crystallisation the same characters can however be assumed independently of the circulation of commodities the classstruggles of the ancient world took the form chiefly of a contest between debtors and creditors which in rome ended in the ruin of the plebeian debtors they were displaced by slaves in the middle ages the contest ended with the ruin of the feudal debtors who lost their political power together with the economic basis on which it was established nevertheless the money relation of debtor and creditor that existed at these two periods reflected only the deeperlying antagonism between the general economic conditions of existence of the classes in question let us return to the circulation of commodities the appearance of the two equivalents commodities and money at the two poles of the process of sale has ceased to be simultaneous the money functions now first as a measure of value in the determination of the price of the commodity sold the price fixed by the contract measures the obligation of the debtor or the sum of money that he has to pay at a fixed date secondly it serves as an ideal means of purchase although existing only in the promise of the buyer to pay it causes the commodity to change hands it is not before the day fixed for payment that the means of payment actually steps into circulation leaves the hand of the buyer for that of the seller the circulating medium was transformed into a hoard because the process stopped short after the first phase because the converted shape of the commodity viz the money was withdrawn from circulation the means of payment enters the circulation but only after the commodity has left it the money is no longer the means that brings about the process it only brings it to a close by stepping in as the absolute form of existence of exchangevalue or as the universal commodity the seller turned his commodity into money in order thereby to satisfy some want the hoarder did the same in order to keep his commodity in its moneyshape and the debtor in order to be able to pay if he do not pay his goods will be sold by the sheriff the valueform of commodities money is therefore now the end and aim of a sale and that owing to a social necessity springing out of the process of circulation itself the buyer converts money back into commodities before he has turned commodities into money in other words he achieves the second metamorphosis of commodities before the first the seller’s commodity circulates and realises its price but only in the shape of a legal claim upon money it is converted into a usevalue before it has been converted into money the completion of its first metamorphosis follows only at a later period the obligations falling due within a given period represent the sum of the prices of the commodities the sale of which gave rise to those obligations the quantity of gold necessary to realise this sum depends in the first instance on the rapidity of currency of the means of payment that quantity is conditioned by two circumstances first the relations between debtors and creditors form a sort of chain in such a way that a when he receives money from his debtor b straightway hands it over to c his creditor and so on the second circumstance is the length of the intervals between the different duedays of the obligations the continuous chain of payments or retarded first metamorphoses is essentially different from that interlacing of the series of metamorphoses which we considered on a former page by the currency of the circulating medium the connexion between buyers and sellers is not merely expressed this connexion is originated by and exists in the circulation alone contrariwise the movement of the means of payment expresses a social relation that was in existence long before the fact that a number of sales take place simultaneously and side by side limits the extent to which coin can be replaced by the rapidity of currency on the other hand this fact is a new lever in economising the means of payment in proportion as payments are concentrated at one spot special institutions and methods are developed for their liquidation such in the middle ages were the virements at lyons the debts due to a from b to b from c to c from a and so on have only to be confronted with each other in order to annul each other to a certain extent like positive and negative quantities there thus remains only a single balance to pay the greater the amount of the payments concentrated the less is this balance relatively to that amount and the less is the mass of the means of payment in circulation the function of money as the means of payment implies a contradiction without a terminus medius in so far as the payments balance one another money functions only ideally as money of account as a measure of value in so far as actual payments have to be made money does not serve as a circulating medium as a mere transient agent in the interchange of products but as the individual incarnation of social labour as the independent form of existence of exchangevalue as the universal commodity this contradiction comes to a head in those phases of industrial and commercial crises which are known as monetary crises such a crisis occurs only where the everlengthening chain of payments and an artificial system of settling them has been fully developed whenever there is a general and extensive disturbance of this mechanism no matter what its cause money becomes suddenly and immediately transformed from its merely ideal shape of money of account into hard cash profane commodities can no longer replace it the usevalue of commodities becomes valueless and their value vanishes in the presence of its own independent form on the eve of the crisis the bourgeois with the selfsufficiency that springs from intoxicating prosperity declares money to be a vain imagination commodities alone are money but now the cry is everywhere money alone is a commodity as the hart pants after fresh water so pants his soul after money the only wealth in a crisis the antithesis between commodities and their valueform money becomes heightened into an absolute contradiction hence in such events the form under which money appears is of no importance the money famine continues whether payments have to be made in gold or in credit money such as banknotes if we now consider the sum total of the money current during a given period we shall find that given the rapidity of currency of the circulating medium and of the means of payment it is equal to the sum of the prices to be realised plus the sum of the payments falling due minus the payments that balance each other minus finally the number of circuits in which the same piece of coin serves in turn as means of circulation and of payment hence even when prices rapidity of currency and the extent of the economy in payments are given the quantity of money current and the mass of commodities circulating during a given period such as a day no longer correspond money that represents commodities long withdrawn from circulation continues to be current commodities circulate whose equivalent in money will not appear on the scene till some future day moreover the debts contracted each day and the payments falling due on the same day are quite incommensurable quantities creditmoney springs directly out of the function of money as a means of payment certificates of the debts owing for the purchased commodities circulate for the purpose of transferring those debts to others on the other hand to the same extent as the system of credit is extended so is the function of money as a means of payment in that character it takes various forms peculiar to itself under which it makes itself at home in the sphere of great commercial transactions gold and silver coin on the other hand are mostly relegated to the sphere of retail trade when the production of commodities has sufficiently extended itself money begins to serve as the means of payment beyond the sphere of the circulation of commodities it becomes the commodity that is the universal subjectmatter of all contracts rents taxes and such like payments are transformed from payments in kind into money payments to what extent this transformation depends upon the general conditions of production is shown to take one example by the fact that the roman empire twice failed in its attempt to levy all contributions in money the unspeakable misery of the french agricultural population under louis xiv a misery so eloquently denounced by boisguillebert marshal vauban and others was due not only to the weight of the taxes but also to the conversion of taxes in kind into money taxes in asia on the other hand the fact that state taxes are chiefly composed of rents payable in kind depends on conditions of production that are reproduced with the regularity of natural phenomena and this mode of payment tends in its turn to maintain the ancient form of production it is one of the secrets of the conservation of the ottoman empire if the foreign trade forced upon japan by europeans should lead to the substitution of money rents for rents in kind it will be all up with the exemplary agriculture of that country the narrow economic conditions under which that agriculture is carried on will be swept away in every country certain days of the year become by habit recognised settling days for various large and recurrent payments these dates depend apart from other revolutions in the wheel of reproduction on conditions closely connected with the seasons they also regulate the dates for payments that have no direct connexion with the circulation of commodities such as taxes rents and so on the quantity of money requisite to make the payments falling due on those dates all over the country causes periodical though merely superficial perturbations in the economy of the medium of payment from the law of the rapidity of currency of the means of payment it follows that the quantity of the means of payment required for all periodical payments whatever their source is in inverse proportion to the length of their periods the development of money into a medium of payment makes it necessary to accumulate money against the dates fixed for the payment of the sums owing while hoarding as a distinct mode of acquiring riches vanishes with the progress of civil society the formation of reserves of the means of payment grows with that progress c universal money when money leaves the home sphere of circulation it strips off the local garbs which it there assumes of a standard of prices of coin of tokens and of a symbol of value and returns to its original form of bullion in the trade between the markets of the world the value of commodities is expressed so as to be universally recognised hence their independent valueform also in these cases confronts them under the shape of universal money it is only in the markets of the world that money acquires to the full extent the character of the commodity whose bodily form is also the immediate social incarnation of human labour in the abstract its real mode of existence in this sphere adequately corresponds to its ideal concept within the sphere of home circulation there can be but one commodity which by serving as a measure of value becomes money in the markets of the world a double measure of value holds sway gold and silver money of the world serves as the universal medium of payment as the universal means of purchasing and as the universally recognised embodiment of all wealth its function as a means of payment in the settling of international balances is its chief one hence the watchword of the mercantilists balance of trade gold and silver serve as international means of purchasing chiefly and necessarily in those periods when the customary equilibrium in the interchange of products between different nations is suddenly disturbed and lastly it serves as the universally recognised embodiment of social wealth whenever the question is not of buying or paying but of transferring wealth from one country to another and whenever this transference in the form of commodities is rendered impossible either by special conjunctures in the markets or by the purpose itself that is intended just as every country needs a reserve of money for its home circulation so too it requires one for external circulation in the markets of the world the functions of hoards therefore arise in part out of the function of money as the medium of the home circulation and home payments and in part out of its function of money of the world for this latter function the genuine moneycommodity actual gold and silver is necessary on that account sir james steuart in order to distinguish them from their purely local substitutes calls gold and silver “money of the world” the current of the stream of gold and silver is a double one on the one hand it spreads itself from its sources over all the markets of the world in order to become absorbed to various extents into the different national spheres of circulation to fill the conduits of currency to replace abraded gold and silver coins to supply the material of articles of luxury and to petrify into hoards this first current is started by the countries that exchange their labour realised in commodities for the labour embodied in the precious metals by gold and silverproducing countries on the other hand there is a continual flowing backwards and forwards of gold and silver between the different national spheres of circulation a current whose motion depends on the ceaseless fluctuations in the course of exchange countries in which the bourgeois form of production is developed to a certain extent limit the hoards concentrated in the strong rooms of the banks to the minimum required for the proper performance of their peculiar functions whenever these hoards are strikingly above their average level it is with some exceptions an indication of stagnation in the circulation of commodities of an interruption in the even flow of their metamorphoses part transformation of money into capital chapter the general formula for capital the circulation of commodities is the startingpoint of capital the production of commodities their circulation and that more developed form of their circulation called commerce these form the historical groundwork from which it rises the modern history of capital dates from the creation in the th century of a worldembracing commerce and a worldembracing market if we abstract from the material substance of the circulation of commodities that is from the exchange of the various usevalues and consider only the economic forms produced by this process of circulation we find its final result to be money this final product of the circulation of commodities is the first form in which capital appears as a matter of history capital as opposed to landed property invariably takes the form at first of money it appears as moneyed wealth as the capital of the merchant and of the usurer but we have no need to refer to the origin of capital in order to discover that the first form of appearance of capital is money we can see it daily under our very eyes all new capital to commence with comes on the stage that is on the market whether of commodities labour or money even in our days in the shape of money that by a definite process has to be transformed into capital the first distinction we notice between money that is money only and money that is capital is nothing more than a difference in their form of circulation the simplest form of the circulation of commodities is cmc the transformation of commodities into money and the change of the money back again into commodities or selling in order to buy but alongside of this form we find another specifically different form mcm the transformation of money into commodities and the change of commodities back again into money or buying in order to sell money that circulates in the latter manner is thereby transformed into becomes capital and is already potentially capital now let us examine the circuit mcm a little closer it consists like the other of two antithetical phases in the first phase mc or the purchase the money is changed into a commodity in the second phase cm or the sale the commodity is changed back again into money the combination of these two phases constitutes the single movement whereby money is exchanged for a commodity and the same commodity is again exchanged for money whereby a commodity is bought in order to be sold or neglecting the distinction in form between buying and selling whereby a commodity is bought with money and then money is bought with a commodity the result in which the phases of the process vanish is the exchange of money for money mm if i purchase lbs of cotton for £ and resell the lbs of cotton for £ i have in fact exchanged £ for £ money for money now it is evident that the circuit mcm would be absurd and without meaning if the intention were to exchange by this means two equal sums of money £ for £ the miser’s plan would be far simpler and surer he sticks to his £ instead of exposing it to the dangers of circulation and yet whether the merchant who has paid £ for his cotton sells it for £ or lets it go for £ or even £ his money has at all events gone through a characteristic and original movement quite different in kind from that which it goes through in the hands of the peasant who sells corn and with the money thus set free buys clothes we have therefore to examine first the distinguishing characteristics of the forms of the circuits mcm and cmc and in doing this the real difference that underlies the mere difference of form will reveal itself let us see in the first place what the two forms have in common both circuits are resolvable into the same two antithetical phases cm a sale and mc a purchase in each of these phases the same material elements a commodity and money and the same economic dramatis personae a buyer and a seller confront one another each circuit is the unity of the same two antithetical phases and in each case this unity is brought about by the intervention of three contracting parties of whom one only sells another only buys while the third both buys and sells what however first and foremost distinguishes the circuit cmc from the circuit mcm is the inverted order of succession of the two phases the simple circulation of commodities begins with a sale and ends with a purchase while the circulation of money as capital begins with a purchase and ends with a sale in the one case both the startingpoint and the goal are commodities in the other they are money in the first form the movement is brought about by the intervention of money in the second by that of a commodity in the circulation cmc the money is in the end converted into a commodity that serves as a usevalue it is spent once for all in the inverted form mcm on the contrary the buyer lays out money in order that as a seller he may recover money by the purchase of his commodity he throws money into circulation in order to withdraw it again by the sale of the same commodity he lets the money go but only with the sly intention of getting it back again the money therefore is not spent it is merely advanced in the circuit cmc the same piece of money changes its place twice the seller gets it from the buyer and pays it away to another seller the complete circulation which begins with the receipt concludes with the payment of money for commodities it is the very contrary in the circuit mcm here it is not the piece of money that changes its place twice but the commodity the buyer takes it from the hands of the seller and passes it into the hands of another buyer just as in the simple circulation of commodities the double change of place of the same piece of money effects its passage from one hand into another so here the double change of place of the same commodity brings about the reflux of the money to its point of departure such reflux is not dependent on the commodity being sold for more than was paid for it this circumstance influences only the amount of the money that comes back the reflux itself takes place so soon as the purchased commodity is resold in other words so soon as the circuit mcm is completed we have here therefore a palpable difference between the circulation of money as capital and its circulation as mere money the circuit cmc comes completely to an end so soon as the money brought in by the sale of one commodity is abstracted again by the purchase of another if nevertheless there follows a reflux of money to its startingpoint this can only happen through a renewal or repetition of the operation if i sell a quarter of corn for £ and with this £ buy clothes the money so far as i am concerned is spent and done with it belongs to the clothes merchant if i now sell a second quarter of corn money indeed flows back to me not however as a sequel to the first transaction but in consequence of its repetition the money again leaves me so soon as i complete this second transaction by a fresh purchase therefore in the circuit cmc the expenditure of money has nothing to do with its reflux on the other hand in mcm the reflux of the money is conditioned by the very mode of its expenditure without this reflux the operation fails or the process is interrupted and incomplete owing to the absence of its complementary and final phase the sale the circuit cmc starts with one commodity and finishes with another which falls out of circulation and into consumption consumption the satisfaction of wants in one word usevalue is its end and aim the circuit mcm on the contrary commences with money and ends with money its leading motive and the goal that attracts it is therefore mere exchangevalue in the simple circulation of commodities the two extremes of the circuit have the same economic form they are both commodities and commodities of equal value but they are also usevalues differing in their qualities as for example corn and clothes the exchange of products of the different materials in which the labour of society is embodied forms here the basis of the movement it is otherwise in the circulation mcm which at first sight appears purposeless because tautological both extremes have the same economic form they are both money and therefore are not qualitatively different usevalues for money is but the converted form of commodities in which their particular usevalues vanish to exchange £ for cotton and then this same cotton again for £ is merely a roundabout way of exchanging money for money the same for the same and appears to be an operation just as purposeless as it is absurd one sum of money is distinguishable from another only by its amount the character and tendency of the process mcm is therefore not due to any qualitative difference between its extremes both being money but solely to their quantitative difference more money is withdrawn from circulation at the finish than was thrown into it at the start the cotton that was bought for £ is perhaps resold for £ £ or £ the exact form of this process is therefore mcm where m m d m the original sum advanced plus an increment this increment or excess over the original value i call “surplusvalue” the value originally advanced therefore not only remains intact while in circulation but adds to itself a surplusvalue or expands itself it is this movement that converts it into capital of course it is also possible that in cmc the two extremes cc say corn and clothes may represent different quantities of value the farmer may sell his corn above its value or may buy the clothes at less than their value he may on the other hand “be done” by the clothes merchant yet in the form of circulation now under consideration such differences in value are purely accidental the fact that the corn and the clothes are equivalents does not deprive the process of all meaning as it does in mcm the equivalence of their values is rather a necessary condition to its normal course the repetition or renewal of the act of selling in order to buy is kept within bounds by the very object it aims at namely consumption or the satisfaction of definite wants an aim that lies altogether outside the sphere of circulation but when we buy in order to sell we on the contrary begin and end with the same thing money exchangevalue and thereby the movement becomes interminable no doubt m becomes m d m £ become £ but when viewed in their qualitative aspect alone £ are the same as £ namely money and considered quantitatively £ is like £ a sum of definite and limited value if now the £ be spent as money they cease to play their part they are no longer capital withdrawn from circulation they become petrified into a hoard and though they remained in that state till doomsday not a single farthing would accrue to them if then the expansion of value is once aimed at there is just the same inducement to augment the value of the £ as that of the £ for both are but limited expressions for exchangevalue and therefore both have the same vocation to approach by quantitative increase as near as possible to absolute wealth momentarily indeed the value originally advanced the £ is distinguishable from the surplusvalue of £ that is annexed to it during circulation but the distinction vanishes immediately at the end of the process we do not receive with one hand the original £ and with the other the surplusvalue of £ we simply get a value of £ which is in exactly the same condition and fitness for commencing the expanding process as the original £ was money ends the movement only to begin it again therefore the final result of every separate circuit in which a purchase and consequent sale are completed forms of itself the startingpoint of a new circuit the simple circulation of commodities selling in order to buy is a means of carrying out a purpose unconnected with circulation namely the appropriation of usevalues the satisfaction of wants the circulation of money as capital is on the contrary an end in itself for the expansion of value takes place only within this constantly renewed movement the circulation of capital has therefore no limits as the conscious representative of this movement the possessor of money becomes a capitalist his person or rather his pocket is the point from which the money starts and to which it returns the expansion of value which is the objective basis or mainspring of the circulation mcm becomes his subjective aim and it is only in so far as the appropriation of ever more and more wealth in the abstract becomes the sole motive of his operations that he functions as a capitalist that is as capital personified and endowed with consciousness and a will usevalues must therefore never be looked upon as the real aim of the capitalist neither must the profit on any single transaction the restless neverending process of profitmaking alone is what he aims at this boundless greed after riches this passionate chase after exchangevalue is common to the capitalist and the miser but while the miser is merely a capitalist gone mad the capitalist is a rational miser the neverending augmentation of exchangevalue which the miser strives after by seeking to save his money from circulation is attained by the more acute capitalist by constantly throwing it afresh into circulation the independent form ie the moneyform which the value of commodities assumes in the case of simple circulation serves only one purpose namely their exchange and vanishes in the final result of the movement on the other hand in the circulation mcm both the money and the commodity represent only different modes of existence of value itself the money its general mode and the commodity its particular or so to say disguised mode it is constantly changing from one form to the other without thereby becoming lost and thus assumes an automatically active character if now we take in turn each of the two different forms which selfexpanding value successively assumes in the course of its life we then arrive at these two propositions capital is money capital is commodities in truth however value is here the active factor in a process in which while constantly assuming the form in turn of money and commodities it at the same time changes in magnitude differentiates itself by throwing off surplusvalue from itself the original value in other words expands spontaneously for the movement in the course of which it adds surplusvalue is its own movement its expansion therefore is automatic expansion because it is value it has acquired the occult quality of being able to add value to itself it brings forth living offspring or at the least lays golden eggs value therefore being the active factor in such a process and assuming at one time the form of money at another that of commodities but through all these changes preserving itself and expanding it requires some independent form by means of which its identity may at any time be established and this form it possesses only in the shape of money it is under the form of money that value begins and ends and begins again every act of its own spontaneous generation it began by being £ it is now £ and so on but the money itself is only one of the two forms of value unless it takes the form of some commodity it does not become capital there is here no antagonism as in the case of hoarding between the money and commodities the capitalist knows that all commodities however scurvy they may look or however badly they may smell are in faith and in truth money inwardly circumcised jews and what is more a wonderful means whereby out of money to make more money in simple circulation cmc the value of commodities attained at the most a form independent of their usevalues ie the form of money but that same value now in the circulation mcm or the circulation of capital suddenly presents itself as an independent substance endowed with a motion of its own passing through a lifeprocess of its own in which money and commodities are mere forms which it assumes and casts off in turn nay more instead of simply representing the relations of commodities it enters now so to say into private relations with itself it differentiates itself as original value from itself as surplusvalue as the father differentiates himself from himself qua the son yet both are one and of one age for only by the surplusvalue of £ does the £ originally advanced become capital and so soon as this takes place so soon as the son and by the son the father is begotten so soon does their difference vanish and they again become one £ value therefore now becomes value in process money in process and as such capital it comes out of circulation enters into it again preserves and multiplies itself within its circuit comes back out of it with expanded bulk and begins the same round ever afresh mm money which begets money such is the description of capital from the mouths of its first interpreters the mercantilists buying in order to sell or more accurately buying in order to sell dearer mcm appears certainly to be a form peculiar to one kind of capital alone namely merchants’ capital but industrial capital too is money that is changed into commodities and by the sale of these commodities is reconverted into more money the events that take place outside the sphere of circulation in the interval between the buying and selling do not affect the form of this movement lastly in the case of interestbearing capital the circulation mcm appears abridged we have its result without the intermediate stage in the form mm “en style lapidaire” so to say money that is worth more money value that is greater than itself mcm is therefore in reality the general formula of capital as it appears prima facie within the sphere of circulation chapter contradictions in the general formula of capital the form which circulation takes when money becomes capital is opposed to all the laws we have hitherto investigated bearing on the nature of commodities value and money and even of circulation itself what distinguishes this form from that of the simple circulation of commodities is the inverted order of succession of the two antithetical processes sale and purchase how can this purely formal distinction between these processes change their character as it were by magic but that is not all this inversion has no existence for two out of the three persons who transact business together as capitalist i buy commodities from a and sell them again to b but as a simple owner of commodities i sell them to b and then purchase fresh ones from a a and b see no difference between the two sets of transactions they are merely buyers or sellers and i on each occasion meet them as a mere owner of either money or commodities as a buyer or a seller and what is more in both sets of transactions i am opposed to a only as a buyer and to b only as a seller to the one only as money to the other only as commodities and to neither of them as capital or a capitalist or as representative of anything that is more than money or commodities or that can produce any effect beyond what money and commodities can for me the purchase from a and the sale to b are part of a series but the connexion between the two acts exists for me alone a does not trouble himself about my transaction with b nor does b about my business with a and if i offered to explain to them the meritorious nature of my action in inverting the order of succession they would probably point out to me that i was mistaken as to that order of succession and that the whole transaction instead of beginning with a purchase and ending with a sale began on the contrary with a sale and was concluded with a purchase in truth my first act the purchase was from the standpoint of a a sale and my second act the sale was from the standpoint of b a purchase not content with that a and b would declare that the whole series was superfluous and nothing but hokus pokus that for the future a would buy direct from b and b sell direct to a thus the whole transaction would be reduced to a single act forming an isolated noncomplemented phase in the ordinary circulation of commodities a mere sale from a’s point of view and from b’s a mere purchase the inversion therefore of the order of succession does not take us outside the sphere of the simple circulation of commodities and we must rather look whether there is in this simple circulation anything permitting an expansion of the value that enters into circulation and consequently a creation of surplusvalue let us take the process of circulation in a form under which it presents itself as a simple and direct exchange of commodities this is always the case when two owners of commodities buy from each other and on the settling day the amounts mutually owing are equal and cancel each other the money in this case is money of account and serves to express the value of the commodities by their prices but is not itself in the shape of hard cash confronted with them so far as regards usevalues it is clear that both parties may gain some advantage both part with goods that as usevalues are of no service to them and receive others that they can make use of and there may also be a further gain a who sells wine and buys corn possibly produces more wine with given labourtime than farmer b could and b on the other hand more corn than winegrower a could a therefore may get for the same exchangevalue more corn and b more wine than each would respectively get without any exchange by producing his own corn and wine with reference therefore to usevalue there is good ground for saying that “exchange is a transaction by which both sides gain” it is otherwise with exchangevalue “a man who has plenty of wine and no corn treats with a man who has plenty of corn and no wine an exchange takes place between them of corn to the value of for wine of the same value this act produces no increase of exchangevalue either for the one or the other for each of them already possessed before the exchange a value equal to that which he acquired by means of that operation” the result is not altered by introducing money as a medium of circulation between the commodities and making the sale and the purchase two distinct acts the value of a commodity is expressed in its price before it goes into circulation and is therefore a precedent condition of circulation not its result abstractedly considered that is apart from circumstances not immediately flowing from the laws of the simple circulation of commodities there is in an exchange nothing if we except the replacing of one usevalue by another but a metamorphosis a mere change in the form of the commodity the same exchangevalue ie the same quantity of incorporated social labour remains throughout in the hands of the owner of the commodity first in the shape of his own commodity then in the form of the money for which he exchanged it and lastly in the shape of the commodity he buys with that money this change of form does not imply a change in the magnitude of the value but the change which the value of the commodity undergoes in this process is limited to a change in its moneyform this form exists first as the price of the commodity offered for sale then as an actual sum of money which however was already expressed in the price and lastly as the price of an equivalent commodity this change of form no more implies taken alone a change in the quantity of value than does the change of a £ note into sovereigns half sovereigns and shillings so far therefore as the circulation of commodities effects a change in the form alone of their values and is free from disturbing influences it must be the exchange of equivalents little as vulgareconomy knows about the nature of value yet whenever it wishes to consider the phenomena of circulation in their purity it assumes that supply and demand are equal which amounts to this that their effect is nil if therefore as regards the usevalues exchanged both buyer and seller may possibly gain something this is not the case as regards the exchangevalues here we must rather say “where equality exists there can be no gain” it is true commodities may be sold at prices deviating from their values but these deviations are to be considered as infractions of the laws of the exchange of commodities which in its normal state is an exchange of equivalents consequently no method for increasing value hence we see that behind all attempts to represent the circulation of commodities as a source of surplusvalue there lurks a quid pro quo a mixing up of usevalue and exchangevalue for instance condillac says “it is not true that on an exchange of commodities we give value for value on the contrary each of the two contracting parties in every case gives a less for a greater value if we really exchanged equal values neither party could make a profit and yet they both gain or ought to gain why the value of a thing consists solely in its relation to our wants what is more to the one is less to the other and vice versâ it is not to be assumed that we offer for sale articles required for our own consumption we wish to part with a useless thing in order to get one that we need we want to give less for more it was natural to think that in an exchange value was given for value whenever each of the articles exchanged was of equal value with the same quantity of gold but there is another point to be considered in our calculation the question is whether we both exchange something superfluous for something necessary” we see in this passage how condillac not only confuses usevalue with exchangevalue but in a really childish manner assumes that in a society in which the production of commodities is well developed each producer produces his own means of subsistence and throws into circulation only the excess over his own requirements still condillac’s argument is frequently used by modern economists more especially when the point is to show that the exchange of commodities in its developed form commerce is productive of surplusvalue for instance “commerce adds value to products for the same products in the hands of consumers are worth more than in the hands of producers and it may strictly be considered an act of production” but commodities are not paid for twice over once on account of their usevalue and again on account of their value and though the usevalue of a commodity is more serviceable to the buyer than to the seller its moneyform is more serviceable to the seller would he otherwise sell it we might therefore just as well say that the buyer performs “strictly an act of production” by converting stockings for example into money if commodities or commodities and money of equal exchangevalue and consequently equivalents are exchanged it is plain that no one abstracts more value from than he throws into circulation there is no creation of surplusvalue and in its normal form the circulation of commodities demands the exchange of equivalents but in actual practice the process does not retain its normal form let us therefore assume an exchange of nonequivalents in any case the market for commodities is only frequented by owners of commodities and the power which these persons exercise over each other is no other than the power of their commodities the material variety of these commodities is the material incentive to the act of exchange and makes buyers and sellers mutually dependent because none of them possesses the object of his own wants and each holds in his hand the object of another’s wants besides these material differences of their usevalues there is only one other difference between commodities namely that between their bodily form and the form into which they are converted by sale the difference between commodities and money and consequently the owners of commodities are distinguishable only as sellers those who own commodities and buyers those who own money suppose then that by some inexplicable privilege the seller is enabled to sell his commodities above their value what is worth for in which case the price is nominally raised the seller therefore pockets a surplusvalue of but after he has sold he becomes a buyer a third owner of commodities comes to him now as seller who in this capacity also enjoys the privilege of selling his commodities too dear our friend gained as a seller only to lose it again as a buyer the net result is that all owners of commodities sell their goods to one another at above their value which comes precisely to the same as if they sold them at their true value such a general and nominal rise of prices has the same effect as if the values had been expressed in weight of silver instead of in weight of gold the nominal prices of commodities would rise but the real relation between their values would remain unchanged let us make the opposite assumption that the buyer has the privilege of purchasing commodities under their value in this case it is no longer necessary to bear in mind that he in his turn will become a seller he was so before he became buyer he had already lost in selling before he gained as buyer everything is just as it was the creation of surplusvalue and therefore the conversion of money into capital can consequently be explained neither on the assumption that commodities are sold above their value nor that they are bought below their value the problem is in no way simplified by introducing irrelevant matters after the manner of col torrens “effectual demand consists in the power and inclination on the part of consumers to give for commodities either by immediate or circuitous barter some greater portion of capital than their production costs” in relation to circulation producers and consumers meet only as buyers and sellers to assert that the surplusvalue acquired by the producer has its origin in the fact that consumers pay for commodities more than their value is only to say in other words the owner of commodities possesses as a seller the privilege of selling too dear the seller has himself produced the commodities or represents their producer but the buyer has to no less extent produced the commodities represented by his money or represents their producer the distinction between them is that one buys and the other sells the fact that the owner of the commodities under the designation of producer sells them over their value and under the designation of consumer pays too much for them does not carry us a single step further to be consistent therefore the upholders of the delusion that surplusvalue has its origin in a nominal rise of prices or in the privilege which the seller has of selling too dear must assume the existence of a class that only buys and does not sell ie only consumes and does not produce the existence of such a class is inexplicable from the standpoint we have so far reached viz that of simple circulation but let us anticipate the money with which such a class is constantly making purchases must constantly flow into their pockets without any exchange gratis by might or right from the pockets of the commodityowners themselves to sell commodities above their value to such a class is only to crib back again a part of the money previously given to it the towns of asia minor thus paid a yearly money tribute to ancient rome with this money rome purchased from them commodities and purchased them too dear the provincials cheated the romans and thus got back from their conquerors in the course of trade a portion of the tribute yet for all that the conquered were the really cheated their goods were still paid for with their own money that is not the way to get rich or to create surplusvalue let us therefore keep within the bounds of exchange where sellers are also buyers and buyers sellers our difficulty may perhaps have arisen from treating the actors as personifications instead of as individuals a may be clever enough to get the advantage of b or c without their being able to retaliate a sells wine worth £ to b and obtains from him in exchange corn to the value of £ a has converted his £ into £ has made more money out of less and has converted his commodities into capital let us examine this a little more closely before the exchange we had £ worth of wine in the hands of a and £ worth of corn in those of b a total value of £ after the exchange we have still the same total value of £ the value in circulation has not increased by one iota it is only distributed differently between a and b what is a loss of value to b is surplusvalue to a what is “minus” to one is “plus” to the other the same change would have taken place if a without the formality of an exchange had directly stolen the £ from b the sum of the values in circulation can clearly not be augmented by any change in their distribution any more than the quantity of the precious metals in a country by a jew selling a queen anne’s farthing for a guinea the capitalist class as a whole in any country cannot overreach themselves turn and twist then as we may the fact remains unaltered if equivalents are exchanged no surplusvalue results and if nonequivalents are exchanged still no surplusvalue circulation or the exchange of commodities begets no value the reason is now therefore plain why in analysing the standard form of capital the form under which it determines the economic organisation of modern society we entirely left out of consideration its most popular and so to say antediluvian forms merchants’ capital and moneylenders’ capital the circuit mcm buying in order to sell dearer is seen most clearly in genuine merchants’ capital but the movement takes place entirely within the sphere of circulation since however it is impossible by circulation alone to account for the conversion of money into capital for the formation of surplusvalue it would appear that merchants’ capital is an impossibility so long as equivalents are exchanged that therefore it can only have its origin in the twofold advantage gained over both the selling and the buying producers by the merchant who parasitically shoves himself in between them it is in this sense that franklin says “war is robbery commerce is generally cheating” if the transformation of merchants’ money into capital is to be explained otherwise than by the producers being simply cheated a long series of intermediate steps would be necessary which at present when the simple circulation of commodities forms our only assumption are entirely wanting what we have said with reference to merchants’ capital applies still more to moneylenders’ capital in merchants’ capital the two extremes the money that is thrown upon the market and the augmented money that is withdrawn from the market are at least connected by a purchase and a sale in other words by the movement of the circulation in moneylenders’ capital the form mcm is reduced to the two extremes without a mean mm money exchanged for more money a form that is incompatible with the nature of money and therefore remains inexplicable from the standpoint of the circulation of commodities hence aristotle “since chrematistic is a double science one part belonging to commerce the other to economic the latter being necessary and praiseworthy the former based on circulation and with justice disapproved for it is not based on nature but on mutual cheating therefore the usurer is most rightly hated because money itself is the source of his gain and is not used for the purposes for which it was invented for it originated for the exchange of commodities but interest makes out of money more money hence its name τοκος interest and offspring for the begotten are like those who beget them but interest is money of money so that of all modes of making a living this is the most contrary to nature” in the course of our investigation we shall find that both merchants’ capital and interestbearing capital are derivative forms and at the same time it will become clear why these two forms appear in the course of history before the modern standard form of capital we have shown that surplusvalue cannot be created by circulation and therefore that in its formation something must take place in the background which is not apparent in the circulation itself but can surplusvalue possibly originate anywhere else than in circulation which is the sum total of all the mutual relations of commodityowners as far as they are determined by their commodities apart from circulation the commodityowner is in relation only with his own commodity so far as regards value that relation is limited to this that the commodity contains a quantity of his own labour that quantity being measured by a definite social standard this quantity is expressed by the value of the commodity and since the value is reckoned in money of account this quantity is also expressed by the price which we will suppose to be £ but his labour is not represented both by the value of the commodity and by a surplus over that value not by a price of that is also a price of not by a value that is greater than itself the commodity owner can by his labour create value but not selfexpanding value he can increase the value of his commodity by adding fresh labour and therefore more value to the value in hand by making for instance leather into boots the same material has now more value because it contains a greater quantity of labour the boots have therefore more value than the leather but the value of the leather remains what it was it has not expanded itself has not during the making of the boots annexed surplusvalue it is therefore impossible that outside the sphere of circulation a producer of commodities can without coming into contact with other commodityowners expand value and consequently convert money or commodities into capital it is therefore impossible for capital to be produced by circulation and it is equally impossible for it to originate apart from circulation it must have its origin both in circulation and yet not in circulation we have therefore got a double result the conversion of money into capital has to be explained on the basis of the laws that regulate the exchange of commodities in such a way that the startingpoint is the exchange of equivalents our friend moneybags who as yet is only an embryo capitalist must buy his commodities at their value must sell them at their value and yet at the end of the process must withdraw more value from circulation than he threw into it at starting his development into a fullgrown capitalist must take place both within the sphere of circulation and without it these are the conditions of the problem hic rhodus hic salta chapter the buying and selling of labourpower the change of value that occurs in the case of money intended to be converted into capital cannot take place in the money itself since in its function of means of purchase and of payment it does no more than realise the price of the commodity it buys or pays for and as hard cash it is value petrified never varying just as little can it originate in the second act of circulation the resale of the commodity which does no more than transform the article from its bodily form back again into its moneyform the change must therefore take place in the commodity bought by the first act mc but not in its value for equivalents are exchanged and the commodity is paid for at its full value we are therefore forced to the conclusion that the change originates in the usevalue as such of the commodity ie in its consumption in order to be able to extract value from the consumption of a commodity our friend moneybags must be so lucky as to find within the sphere of circulation in the market a commodity whose usevalue possesses the peculiar property of being a source of value whose actual consumption therefore is itself an embodiment of labour and consequently a creation of value the possessor of money does find on the market such a special commodity in capacity for labour or labourpower by labourpower or capacity for labour is to be understood the aggregate of those mental and physical capabilities existing in a human being which he exercises whenever he produces a usevalue of any description but in order that our owner of money may be able to find labourpower offered for sale as a commodity various conditions must first be fulfilled the exchange of commodities of itself implies no other relations of dependence than those which result from its own nature on this assumption labourpower can appear upon the market as a commodity only if and so far as its possessor the individual whose labourpower it is offers it for sale or sells it as a commodity in order that he may be able to do this he must have it at his disposal must be the untrammelled owner of his capacity for labour ie of his person he and the owner of money meet in the market and deal with each other as on the basis of equal rights with this difference alone that one is buyer the other seller both therefore equal in the eyes of the law the continuance of this relation demands that the owner of the labourpower should sell it only for a definite period for if he were to sell it rump and stump once for all he would be selling himself converting himself from a free man into a slave from an owner of a commodity into a commodity he must constantly look upon his labourpower as his own property his own commodity and this he can only do by placing it at the disposal of the buyer temporarily for a definite period of time by this means alone can he avoid renouncing his rights of ownership over it the second essential condition to the owner of money finding labourpower in the market as a commodity is this – that the labourer instead of being in the position to sell commodities in which his labour is incorporated must be obliged to offer for sale as a commodity that very labourpower which exists only in his living self in order that a man may be able to sell commodities other than labourpower he must of course have the means of production as raw material implements c no boots can be made without leather he requires also the means of subsistence nobody – not even “a musician of the future” – can live upon future products or upon usevalues in an unfinished state and ever since the first moment of his appearance on the world’s stage man always has been and must still be a consumer both before and while he is producing in a society where all products assume the form of commodities these commodities must be sold after they have been produced it is only after their sale that they can serve in satisfying the requirements of their producer the time necessary for their sale is superadded to that necessary for their production for the conversion of his money into capital therefore the owner of money must meet in the market with the free labourer free in the double sense that as a free man he can dispose of his labourpower as his own commodity and that on the other hand he has no other commodity for sale is short of everything necessary for the realisation of his labourpower the question why this free labourer confronts him in the market has no interest for the owner of money who regards the labourmarket as a branch of the general market for commodities and for the present it interests us just as little we cling to the fact theoretically as he does practically one thing however is clear – nature does not produce on the one side owners of money or commodities and on the other men possessing nothing but their own labourpower this relation has no natural basis neither is its social basis one that is common to all historical periods it is clearly the result of a past historical development the product of many economic revolutions of the extinction of a whole series of older forms of social production so too the economic categories already discussed by us bear the stamp of history definite historical conditions are necessary that a product may become a commodity it must not be produced as the immediate means of subsistence of the producer himself had we gone further and inquired under what circumstances all or even the majority of products take the form of commodities we should have found that this can only happen with production of a very specific kind capitalist production such an inquiry however would have been foreign to the analysis of commodities production and circulation of commodities can take place although the great mass of the objects produced are intended for the immediate requirements of their producers are not turned into commodities and consequently social production is not yet by a long way dominated in its length and breadth by exchangevalue the appearance of products as commodities presupposes such a development of the social division of labour that the separation of usevalue from exchangevalue a separation which first begins with barter must already have been completed but such a degree of development is common to many forms of society which in other respects present the most varying historical features on the other hand if we consider money its existence implies a definite stage in the exchange of commodities the particular functions of money which it performs either as the mere equivalent of commodities or as means of circulation or means of payment as hoard or as universal money point according to the extent and relative preponderance of the one function or the other to very different stages in the process of social production yet we know by experience that a circulation of commodities relatively primitive suffices for the production of all these forms otherwise with capital the historical conditions of its existence are by no means given with the mere circulation of money and commodities it can spring into life only when the owner of the means of production and subsistence meets in the market with the free labourer selling his labourpower and this one historical condition comprises a world’s history capital therefore announces from its first appearance a new epoch in the process of social production we must now examine more closely this peculiar commodity labourpower like all others it has a value how is that value determined the value of labourpower is determined as in the case of every other commodity by the labourtime necessary for the production and consequently also the reproduction of this special article so far as it has value it represents no more than a definite quantity of the average labour of society incorporated in it labourpower exists only as a capacity or power of the living individual its production consequently presupposes his existence given the individual the production of labourpower consists in his reproduction of himself or his maintenance for his maintenance he requires a given quantity of the means of subsistence therefore the labourtime requisite for the production of labourpower reduces itself to that necessary for the production of those means of subsistence in other words the value of labourpower is the value of the means of subsistence necessary for the maintenance of the labourer labourpower however becomes a reality only by its exercise it sets itself in action only by working but thereby a definite quantity of human muscle nerve brain c is wasted and these require to be restored this increased expenditure demands a larger income if the owner of labourpower works today tomorrow he must again be able to repeat the same process in the same conditions as regards health and strength his means of subsistence must therefore be sufficient to maintain him in his normal state as a labouring individual his natural wants such as food clothing fuel and housing vary according to the climatic and other physical conditions of his country on the other hand the number and extent of his socalled necessary wants as also the modes of satisfying them are themselves the product of historical development and depend therefore to a great extent on the degree of civilisation of a country more particularly on the conditions under which and consequently on the habits and degree of comfort in which the class of free labourers has been formed in contradistinction therefore to the case of other commodities there enters into the determination of the value of labourpower a historical and moral element nevertheless in a given country at a given period the average quantity of the means of subsistence necessary for the labourer is practically known the owner of labourpower is mortal if then his appearance in the market is to be continuous and the continuous conversion of money into capital assumes this the seller of labourpower must perpetuate himself “in the way that every living individual perpetuates himself by procreation” the labourpower withdrawn from the market by wear and tear and death must be continually replaced by at the very least an equal amount of fresh labourpower hence the sum of the means of subsistence necessary for the production of labourpower must include the means necessary for the labourer’s substitutes ie his children in order that this race of peculiar commodityowners may perpetuate its appearance in the market in order to modify the human organism so that it may acquire skill and handiness in a given branch of industry and become labourpower of a special kind a special education or training is requisite and this on its part costs an equivalent in commodities of a greater or less amount this amount varies according to the more or less complicated character of the labourpower the expenses of this education excessively small in the case of ordinary labourpower enter pro tanto into the total value spent in its production the value of labourpower resolves itself into the value of a definite quantity of the means of subsistence it therefore varies with the value of these means or with the quantity of labour requisite for their production some of the means of subsistence such as food and fuel are consumed daily and a fresh supply must be provided daily others such as clothes and furniture last for longer periods and require to be replaced only at longer intervals one article must be bought or paid for daily another weekly another quarterly and so on but in whatever way the sum total of these outlays may be spread over the year they must be covered by the average income taking one day with another if the total of the commodities required daily for the production of labourpower a and those required weekly b and those required quarterly c and so on the daily average of these commodities a b c c suppose that in this mass of commodities requisite for the average day there are embodied hours of social labour then there is incorporated daily in labourpower half a day’s average social labour in other words half a day’s labour is requisite for the daily production of labourpower this quantity of labour forms the value of a day’s labourpower or the value of the labourpower daily reproduced if half a day’s average social labour is incorporated in three shillings then three shillings is the price corresponding to the value of a day’s labourpower if its owner therefore offers it for sale at three shillings a day its selling price is equal to its value and according to our supposition our friend moneybags who is intent upon converting his three shillings into capital pays this value the minimum limit of the value of labourpower is determined by the value of the commodities without the daily supply of which the labourer cannot renew his vital energy consequently by the value of those means of subsistence that are physically indispensable if the price of labourpower fall to this minimum it falls below its value since under such circumstances it can be maintained and developed only in a crippled state but the value of every commodity is determined by the labourtime requisite to turn it out so as to be of normal quality it is a very cheap sort of sentimentality which declares this method of determining the value of labourpower a method prescribed by the very nature of the case to be a brutal method and which wails with rossi that “to comprehend capacity for labour puissance de travail at the same time that we make abstraction from the means of subsistence of the labourers during the process of production is to comprehend a phantom être de raison when we speak of labour or capacity for labour we speak at the same time of the labourer and his means of subsistence of labourer and wages” when we speak of capacity for labour we do not speak of labour any more than when we speak of capacity for digestion we speak of digestion the latter process requires something more than a good stomach when we speak of capacity for labour we do not abstract from the necessary means of subsistence on the contrary their value is expressed in its value if his capacity for labour remains unsold the labourer derives no benefit from it but rather he will feel it to be a cruel natureimposed necessity that this capacity has cost for its production a definite amount of the means of subsistence and that it will continue to do so for its reproduction he will then agree with sismondi “that capacity for labour is nothing unless it is sold” one consequence of the peculiar nature of labourpower as a commodity is that its usevalue does not on the conclusion of the contract between the buyer and seller immediately pass into the hands of the former its value like that of every other commodity is already fixed before it goes into circulation since a definite quantity of social labour has been spent upon it but its usevalue consists in the subsequent exercise of its force the alienation of labourpower and its actual appropriation by the buyer its employment as a usevalue are separated by an interval of time but in those cases in which the formal alienation by sale of the usevalue of a commodity is not simultaneous with its actual delivery to the buyer the money of the latter usually functions as means of payment in every country in which the capitalist mode of production reigns it is the custom not to pay for labourpower before it has been exercised for the period fixed by the contract as for example the end of each week in all cases therefore the usevalue of the labourpower is advanced to the capitalist the labourer allows the buyer to consume it before he receives payment of the price he everywhere gives credit to the capitalist that this credit is no mere fiction is shown not only by the occasional loss of wages on the bankruptcy of the capitalist but also by a series of more enduring consequences nevertheless whether money serves as a means of purchase or as a means of payment this makes no alteration in the nature of the exchange of commodities the price of the labourpower is fixed by the contract although it is not realised till later like the rent of a house the labourpower is sold although it is only paid for at a later period it will therefore be useful for a clear comprehension of the relation of the parties to assume provisionally that the possessor of labourpower on the occasion of each sale immediately receives the price stipulated to be paid for it we now know how the value paid by the purchaser to the possessor of this peculiar commodity labourpower is determined the usevalue which the former gets in exchange manifests itself only in the actual utilisation in the consumption of the labourpower the moneyowner buys everything necessary for this purpose such as raw material in the market and pays for it at its full value the consumption of labourpower is at one and the same time the production of commodities and of surplusvalue the consumption of labourpower is completed as in the case of every other commodity outside the limits of the market or of the sphere of circulation accompanied by mr moneybags and by the possessor of labourpower we therefore take leave for a time of this noisy sphere where everything takes place on the surface and in view of all men and follow them both into the hidden abode of production on whose threshold there stares us in the face “no admittance except on business” here we shall see not only how capital produces but how capital is produced we shall at last force the secret of profit making this sphere that we are deserting within whose boundaries the sale and purchase of labourpower goes on is in fact a very eden of the innate rights of man there alone rule freedom equality property and bentham freedom because both buyer and seller of a commodity say of labourpower are constrained only by their own free will they contract as free agents and the agreement they come to is but the form in which they give legal expression to their common will equality because each enters into relation with the other as with a simple owner of commodities and they exchange equivalent for equivalent property because each disposes only of what is his own and bentham because each looks only to himself the only force that brings them together and puts them in relation with each other is the selfishness the gain and the private interests of each each looks to himself only and no one troubles himself about the rest and just because they do so do they all in accordance with the preestablished harmony of things or under the auspices of an allshrewd providence work together to their mutual advantage for the common weal and in the interest of all on leaving this sphere of simple circulation or of exchange of commodities which furnishes the “freetrader vulgaris” with his views and ideas and with the standard by which he judges a society based on capital and wages we think we can perceive a change in the physiognomy of our dramatis personae he who before was the moneyowner now strides in front as capitalist the possessor of labourpower follows as his labourer the one with an air of importance smirking intent on business the other timid and holding back like one who is bringing his own hide to market and has nothing to expect but – a hiding part the production of absolute surplusvalue chapter the labourprocess and the process of producing surplusvalue section the labourprocess or the production of usevalues the capitalist buys labourpower in order to use it and labourpower in use is labour itself the purchaser of labourpower consumes it by setting the seller of it to work by working the latter becomes actually what before he only was potentially labourpower in action a labourer in order that his labour may reappear in a commodity he must before all things expend it on something useful on something capable of satisfying a want of some sort hence what the capitalist sets the labourer to produce is a particular usevalue a specified article the fact that the production of usevalues or goods is carried on under the control of a capitalist and on his behalf does not alter the general character of that production we shall therefore in the first place have to consider the labourprocess independently of the particular form it assumes under given social conditions labour is in the first place a process in which both man and nature participate and in which man of his own accord starts regulates and controls the material reactions between himself and nature he opposes himself to nature as one of her own forces setting in motion arms and legs head and hands the natural forces of his body in order to appropriate nature’s productions in a form adapted to his own wants by thus acting on the external world and changing it he at the same time changes his own nature he develops his slumbering powers and compels them to act in obedience to his sway we are not now dealing with those primitive instinctive forms of labour that remind us of the mere animal an immeasurable interval of time separates the state of things in which a man brings his labourpower to market for sale as a commodity from that state in which human labour was still in its first instinctive stage we presuppose labour in a form that stamps it as exclusively human a spider conducts operations that resemble those of a weaver and a bee puts to shame many an architect in the construction of her cells but what distinguishes the worst architect from the best of bees is this that the architect raises his structure in imagination before he erects it in reality at the end of every labourprocess we get a result that already existed in the imagination of the labourer at its commencement he not only effects a change of form in the material on which he works but he also realises a purpose of his own that gives the law to his modus operandi and to which he must subordinate his will and this subordination is no mere momentary act besides the exertion of the bodily organs the process demands that during the whole operation the workman’s will be steadily in consonance with his purpose this means close attention the less he is attracted by the nature of the work and the mode in which it is carried on and the less therefore he enjoys it as something which gives play to his bodily and mental powers the more close his attention is forced to be the elementary factors of the labourprocess are the personal activity of man ie work itself the subject of that work and its instruments the soil and this economically speaking includes water in the virgin state in which it supplies man with necessaries or the means of subsistence ready to hand exists independently of him and is the universal subject of human labour all those things which labour merely separates from immediate connexion with their environment are subjects of labour spontaneously provided by nature such are fish which we catch and take from their element water timber which we fell in the virgin forest and ores which we extract from their veins if on the other hand the subject of labour has so to say been filtered through previous labour we call it raw material such is ore already extracted and ready for washing all raw material is the subject of labour but not every subject of labour is raw material it can only become so after it has undergone some alteration by means of labour an instrument of labour is a thing or a complex of things which the labourer interposes between himself and the subject of his labour and which serves as the conductor of his activity he makes use of the mechanical physical and chemical properties of some substances in order to make other substances subservient to his aims leaving out of consideration such readymade means of subsistence as fruits in gathering which a man’s own limbs serve as the instruments of his labour the first thing of which the labourer possesses himself is not the subject of labour but its instrument thus nature becomes one of the organs of his activity one that he annexes to his own bodily organs adding stature to himself in spite of the bible as the earth is his original larder so too it is his original tool house it supplies him for instance with stones for throwing grinding pressing cutting c the earth itself is an instrument of labour but when used as such in agriculture implies a whole series of other instruments and a comparatively high development of labour no sooner does labour undergo the least development than it requires specially prepared instruments thus in the oldest caves we find stone implements and weapons in the earliest period of human history domesticated animals ie animals which have been bred for the purpose and have undergone modifications by means of labour play the chief part as instruments of labour along with specially prepared stones wood bones and shells the use and fabrication of instruments of labour although existing in the germ among certain species of animals is specifically characteristic of the human labourprocess and franklin therefore defines man as a toolmaking animal relics of bygone instruments of labour possess the same importance for the investigation of extinct economic forms of society as do fossil bones for the determination of extinct species of animals it is not the articles made but how they are made and by what instruments that enables us to distinguish different economic epochs instruments of labour not only supply a standard of the degree of development to which human labour has attained but they are also indicators of the social conditions under which that labour is carried on among the instruments of labour those of a mechanical nature which taken as a whole we may call the bone and muscles of production offer much more decided characteristics of a given epoch of production than those which like pipes tubs baskets jars c serve only to hold the materials for labour which latter class we may in a general way call the vascular system of production the latter first begins to play an important part in the chemical industries in a wider sense we may include among the instruments of labour in addition to those things that are used for directly transferring labour to its subject and which therefore in one way or another serve as conductors of activity all such objects as are necessary for carrying on the labourprocess these do not enter directly into the process but without them it is either impossible for it to take place at all or possible only to a partial extent once more we find the earth to be a universal instrument of this sort for it furnishes a locus standi to the labourer and a field of employment for his activity among instruments that are the result of previous labour and also belong to this class we find workshops canals roads and so forth in the labourprocess therefore man’s activity with the help of the instruments of labour effects an alteration designed from the commencement in the material worked upon the process disappears in the product the latter is a usevalue nature’s material adapted by a change of form to the wants of man labour has incorporated itself with its subject the former is materialised the latter transformed that which in the labourer appeared as movement now appears in the product as a fixed quality without motion the blacksmith forges and the product is a forging if we examine the whole process from the point of view of its result the product it is plain that both the instruments and the subject of labour are means of production and that the labour itself is productive labour though a usevalue in the form of a product issues from the labourprocess yet other usevalues products of previous labour enter into it as means of production the same usevalue is both the product of a previous process and a means of production in a later process products are therefore not only results but also essential conditions of labour with the exception of the extractive industries in which the material for labour is provided immediately by nature such as mining hunting fishing and agriculture so far as the latter is confined to breaking up virgin soil all branches of industry manipulate raw material objects already filtered through labour already products of labour such is seed in agriculture animals and plants which we are accustomed to consider as products of nature are in their present form not only products of say last year’s labour but the result of a gradual transformation continued through many generations under man’s superintendence and by means of his labour but in the great majority of cases instruments of labour show even to the most superficial observer traces of the labour of past ages raw material may either form the principal substance of a product or it may enter into its formation only as an accessory an accessory may be consumed by the instruments of labour as coal under a boiler oil by a wheel hay by drafthorses or it may be mixed with the raw material in order to produce some modification thereof as chlorine into unbleached linen coal with iron dyestuff with wool or again it may help to carry on the work itself as in the case of the materials used for heating and lighting workshops the distinction between principal substance and accessory vanishes in the true chemical industries because there none of the raw material reappears in its original composition in the substance of the product every object possesses various properties and is thus capable of being applied to different uses one and the same product may therefore serve as raw material in very different processes corn for example is a raw material for millers starchmanufacturers distillers and cattlebreeders it also enters as raw material into its own production in the shape of seed coal too is at the same time the product of and a means of production in coalmining again a particular product may be used in one and the same process both as an instrument of labour and as raw material take for instance the fattening of cattle where the animal is the raw material and at the same time an instrument for the production of manure a product though ready for immediate consumption may yet serve as raw material for a further product as grapes when they become the raw material for wine on the other hand labour may give us its product in such a form that we can use it only as raw material as is the case with cotton thread and yarn such a raw material though itself a product may have to go through a whole series of different processes in each of these in turn it serves with constantly varying form as raw material until the last process of the series leaves it a perfect product ready for individual consumption or for use as an instrument of labour hence we see that whether a usevalue is to be regarded as raw material as instrument of labour or as product this is determined entirely by its function in the labourprocess by the position it there occupies as this varies so does its character whenever therefore a product enters as a means of production into a new labourprocess it thereby loses its character of product and becomes a mere factor in the process a spinner treats spindles only as implements for spinning and flax only as the material that he spins of course it is impossible to spin without material and spindles and therefore the existence of these things as products at the commencement of the spinning operation must be presumed but in the process itself the fact that they are products of previous labour is a matter of utter indifference just as in the digestive process it is of no importance whatever that bread is the produce of the previous labour of the farmer the miller and the baker on the contrary it is generally by their imperfections as products that the means of production in any process assert themselves in their character of products a blunt knife or weak thread forcibly remind us of mr a the cutler or mr b the spinner in the finished product the labour by means of which it has acquired its useful qualities is not palpable has apparently vanished a machine which does not serve the purposes of labour is useless in addition it falls a prey to the destructive influence of natural forces iron rusts and wood rots yarn with which we neither weave nor knit is cotton wasted living labour must seize upon these things and rouse them from their deathsleep change them from mere possible usevalues into real and effective ones bathed in the fire of labour appropriated as part and parcel of labour’s organism and as it were made alive for the performance of their functions in the process they are in truth consumed but consumed with a purpose as elementary constituents of new usevalues of new products ever ready as means of subsistence for individual consumption or as means of production for some new labourprocess if then on the one hand finished products are not only results but also necessary conditions of the labourprocess on the other hand their assumption into that process their contact with living labour is the sole means by which they can be made to retain their character of usevalues and be utilised labour uses up its material factors its subject and its instruments consumes them and is therefore a process of consumption such productive consumption is distinguished from individual consumption by this that the latter uses up products as means of subsistence for the living individual the former as means whereby alone labour the labourpower of the living individual is enabled to act the product therefore of individual consumption is the consumer himself the result of productive consumption is a product distinct from the consumer in so far then as its instruments and subjects are themselves products labour consumes products in order to create products or in other words consumes one set of products by turning them into means of production for another set but just as in the beginning the only participators in the labourprocess were man and the earth which latter exists independently of man so even now we still employ in the process many means of production provided directly by nature that do not represent any combination of natural substances with human labour the labourprocess resolved as above into its simple elementary factors is human action with a view to the production of usevalues appropriation of natural substances to human requirements it is the necessary condition for effecting exchange of matter between man and nature it is the everlasting natureimposed condition of human existence and therefore is independent of every social phase of that existence or rather is common to every such phase it was therefore not necessary to represent our labourer in connexion with other labourers man and his labour on one side nature and its materials on the other sufficed as the taste of the porridge does not tell you who grew the oats no more does this simple process tell you of itself what are the social conditions under which it is taking place whether under the slaveowner’s brutal lash or the anxious eye of the capitalist whether cincinnatus carries it on in tilling his modest farm or a savage in killing wild animals with stones let us now return to our wouldbe capitalist we left him just after he had purchased in the open market all the necessary factors of the labour process its objective factors the means of production as well as its subjective factor labourpower with the keen eye of an expert he has selected the means of production and the kind of labourpower best adapted to his particular trade be it spinning bootmaking or any other kind he then proceeds to consume the commodity the labourpower that he has just bought by causing the labourer the impersonation of that labourpower to consume the means of production by his labour the general character of the labourprocess is evidently not changed by the fact that the labourer works for the capitalist instead of for himself moreover the particular methods and operations employed in bootmaking or spinning are not immediately changed by the intervention of the capitalist he must begin by taking the labourpower as he finds it in the market and consequently be satisfied with labour of such a kind as would be found in the period immediately preceding the rise of capitalists changes in the methods of production by the subordination of labour to capital can take place only at a later period and therefore will have to be treated of in a later chapter the labourprocess turned into the process by which the capitalist consumes labourpower exhibits two characteristic phenomena first the labourer works under the control of the capitalist to whom his labour belongs the capitalist taking good care that the work is done in a proper manner and that the means of production are used with intelligence so that there is no unnecessary waste of raw material and no wear and tear of the implements beyond what is necessarily caused by the work secondly the product is the property of the capitalist and not that of the labourer its immediate producer suppose that a capitalist pays for a day’s labourpower at its value then the right to use that power for a day belongs to him just as much as the right to use any other commodity such as a horse that he has hired for the day to the purchaser of a commodity belongs its use and the seller of labourpower by giving his labour does no more in reality than part with the usevalue that he has sold from the instant he steps into the workshop the usevalue of his labourpower and therefore also its use which is labour belongs to the capitalist by the purchase of labourpower the capitalist incorporates labour as a living ferment with the lifeless constituents of the product from his point of view the labourprocess is nothing more than the consumption of the commodity purchased i e of labourpower but this consumption cannot be effected except by supplying the labourpower with the means of production the labourprocess is a process between things that the capitalist has purchased things that have become his property the product of this process belongs therefore to him just as much as does the wine which is the product of a process of fermentation completed in his cellar section the production of surplusvalue the product appropriated by the capitalist is a usevalue as yarn for example or boots but although boots are in one sense the basis of all social progress and our capitalist is a decided “progressist” yet he does not manufacture boots for their own sake usevalue is by no means the thing “qu’on aime pour luimême” in the production of commodities usevalues are only produced by capitalists because and in so far as they are the material substratum the depositories of exchangevalue our capitalist has two objects in view in the first place he wants to produce a usevalue that has a value in exchange that is to say an article destined to be sold a commodity and secondly he desires to produce a commodity whose value shall be greater than the sum of the values of the commodities used in its production that is of the means of production and the labourpower that he purchased with his good money in the open market his aim is to produce not only a usevalue but a commodity also not only usevalue but value not only value but at the same time surplusvalue it must be borne in mind that we are now dealing with the production of commodities and that up to this point we have only considered one aspect of the process just as commodities are at the same time usevalues and values so the process of producing them must be a labourprocess and at the same time a process of creating value let us now examine production as a creation of value we know that the value of each commodity is determined by the quantity of labour expended on and materialised in it by the workingtime necessary under given social conditions for its production this rule also holds good in the case of the product that accrued to our capitalist as the result of the labourprocess carried on for him assuming this product to be lbs of yarn our first step is to calculate the quantity of labour realised in it for spinning the yarn raw material is required suppose in this case lbs of cotton we have no need at present to investigate the value of this cotton for our capitalist has we will assume bought it at its full value say of ten shillings in this price the labour required for the production of the cotton is already expressed in terms of the average labour of society we will further assume that the wear and tear of the spindle which for our present purpose may represent all other instruments of labour employed amounts to the value of s if then twentyfour hours’ labour or two working days are required to produce the quantity of gold represented by twelve shillings we have here to begin with two days’ labour already incorporated in the yarn we must not let ourselves be misled by the circumstance that the cotton has taken a new shape while the substance of the spindle has to a certain extent been used up by the general law of value if the value of lbs of yarn the value of lbs of cotton the value of a whole spindle i e if the same workingtime is required to produce the commodities on either side of this equation then lbs of yarn are an equivalent for lbs of cotton together with onefourth of a spindle in the case we are considering the same workingtime is materialised in the lbs of yarn on the one hand and in the lbs of cotton and the fraction of a spindle on the other therefore whether value appears in cotton in a spindle or in yarn makes no difference in the amount of that value the spindle and cotton instead of resting quietly side by side join together in the process their forms are altered and they are turned into yarn but their value is no more affected by this fact than it would be if they had been simply exchanged for their equivalent in yarn the labour required for the production of the cotton the raw material of the yarn is part of the labour necessary to produce the yarn and is therefore contained in the yarn the same applies to the labour embodied in the spindle without whose wear and tear the cotton could not be spun hence in determining the value of the yarn or the labourtime required for its production all the special processes carried on at various times and in different places which were necessary first to produce the cotton and the wasted portion of the spindle and then with the cotton and spindle to spin the yarn may together be looked on as different and successive phases of one and the same process the whole of the labour in the yarn is past labour and it is a matter of no importance that the operations necessary for the production of its constituent elements were carried on at times which referred to the present are more remote than the final operation of spinning if a definite quantity of labour say thirty days is requisite to build a house the total amount of labour incorporated in it is not altered by the fact that the work of the last day is done twentynine days later than that of the first therefore the labour contained in the raw material and the instruments of labour can be treated just as if it were labour expended in an earlier stage of the spinning process before the labour of actual spinning commenced the values of the means of production i e the cotton and the spindle which values are expressed in the price of twelve shillings are therefore constituent parts of the value of the yarn or in other words of the value of the product two conditions must nevertheless be fulfilled first the cotton and spindle must concur in the production of a usevalue they must in the present case become yarn value is independent of the particular usevalue by which it is borne but it must be embodied in a usevalue of some kind secondly the time occupied in the labour of production must not exceed the time really necessary under the given social conditions of the case therefore if no more than lb of cotton be requisite to spin lb of yarn care must be taken that no more than this weight of cotton is consumed in the production of lb of yarn and similarly with regard to the spindle though the capitalist have a hobby and use a gold instead of a steel spindle yet the only labour that counts for anything in the value of the yarn is that which would be required to produce a steel spindle because no more is necessary under the given social conditions we now know what portion of the value of the yarn is owing to the cotton and the spindle it amounts to twelve shillings or the value of two days’ work the next point for our consideration is what portion of the value of the yarn is added to the cotton by the labour of the spinner we have now to consider this labour under a very different aspect from that which it had during the labourprocess there we viewed it solely as that particular kind of human activity which changes cotton into yarn there the more the labour was suited to the work the better the yarn other circumstances remaining the same the labour of the spinner was then viewed as specifically different from other kinds of productive labour different on the one hand in its special aim viz spinning different on the other hand in the special character of its operations in the special nature of its means of production and in the special usevalue of its product for the operation of spinning cotton and spindles are a necessity but for making rifled cannon they would be of no use whatever here on the contrary where we consider the labour of the spinner only so far as it is valuecreating ie a source of value his labour differs in no respect from the labour of the man who bores cannon or what here more nearly concerns us from the labour of the cottonplanter and spindlemaker incorporated in the means of production it is solely by reason of this identity that cotton planting spindle making and spinning are capable of forming the component parts differing only quantitatively from each other of one whole namely the value of the yarn here we have nothing more to do with the quality the nature and the specific character of the labour but merely with its quantity and this simply requires to be calculated we proceed upon the assumption that spinning is simple unskilled labour the average labour of a given state of society hereafter we shall see that the contrary assumption would make no difference while the labourer is at work his labour constantly undergoes a transformation from being motion it becomes an object without motion from being the labourer working it becomes the thing produced at the end of one hour’s spinning that act is represented by a definite quantity of yarn in other words a definite quantity of labour namely that of one hour has become embodied in the cotton we say labour ie the expenditure of his vital force by the spinner and not spinning labour because the special work of spinning counts here only so far as it is the expenditure of labourpower in general and not in so far as it is the specific work of the spinner in the process we are now considering it is of extreme importance that no more time be consumed in the work of transforming the cotton into yarn than is necessary under the given social conditions if under normal ie average social conditions of production a pounds of cotton ought to be made into b pounds of yarn by one hour’s labour then a day’s labour does not count as hours’ labour unless a pounds of cotton have been made into b pounds of yarn for in the creation of value the time that is socially necessary alone counts not only the labour but also the raw material and the product now appear in quite a new light very different from that in which we viewed them in the labourprocess pure and simple the raw material serves now merely as an absorbent of a definite quantity of labour by this absorption it is in fact changed into yarn because it is spun because labourpower in the form of spinning is added to it but the product the yarn is now nothing more than a measure of the labour absorbed by the cotton if in one hour lbs of cotton can be spun into lbs of yarn then lbs of yarn indicate the absorption of hours’ labour definite quantities of product these quantities being determined by experience now represent nothing but definite quantities of labour definite masses of crystallised labourtime they are nothing more than the materialisation of so many hours or so many days of social labour we are here no more concerned about the facts that the labour is the specific work of spinning that its subject is cotton and its product yarn than we are about the fact that the subject itself is already a product and therefore raw material if the spinner instead of spinning were working in a coal mine the subject of his labour the coal would be supplied by nature nevertheless a definite quantity of extracted coal a hundredweight for example would represent a definite quantity of absorbed labour we assumed on the occasion of its sale that the value of a day’s labourpower is three shillings and that six hours’ labour is incorporated in that sum and consequently that this amount of labour is requisite to produce the necessaries of life daily required on an average by the labourer if now our spinner by working for one hour can convert lbs of cotton into lbs of yarn it follows that in six hours he will convert lbs of cotton into lbs of yarn hence during the spinning process the cotton absorbs six hours’ labour the same quantity of labour is also embodied in a piece of gold of the value of three shillings consequently by the mere labour of spinning a value of three shillings is added to the cotton let us now consider the total value of the product the lbs of yarn two and a half days’ labour has been embodied in it of which two days were contained in the cotton and in the substance of the spindle worn away and half a day was absorbed during the process of spinning this two and a half days’ labour is also represented by a piece of gold of the value of fifteen shillings hence fifteen shillings is an adequate price for the lbs of yarn or the price of one pound is eighteenpence our capitalist stares in astonishment the value of the product is exactly equal to the value of the capital advanced the value so advanced has not expanded no surplusvalue has been created and consequently money has not been converted into capital the price of the yarn is fifteen shillings and fifteen shillings were spent in the open market upon the constituent elements of the product or what amounts to the same thing upon the factors of the labourprocess ten shillings were paid for the cotton two shillings for the substance of the spindle worn away and three shillings for the labourpower the swollen value of the yarn is of no avail for it is merely the sum of the values formerly existing in the cotton the spindle and the labourpower out of such a simple addition of existing values no surplusvalue can possibly arise these separate values are now all concentrated in one thing but so they were also in the sum of fifteen shillings before it was split up into three parts by the purchase of the commodities there is in reality nothing very strange in this result the value of one pound of yarn being eighteenpence if our capitalist buys lbs of yarn in the market he must pay fifteen shillings for them it is clear that whether a man buys his house ready built or gets it built for him in neither case will the mode of acquisition increase the amount of money laid out on the house our capitalist who is at home in his vulgar economy exclaims “oh but i advanced my money for the express purpose of making more money” the way to hell is paved with good intentions and he might just as easily have intended to make money without producing at all he threatens all sorts of things he won’t be caught napping again in future he will buy the commodities in the market instead of manufacturing them himself but if all his brother capitalists were to do the same where would he find his commodities in the market and his money he cannot eat he tries persuasion “consider my abstinence i might have played ducks and drakes with the shillings but instead of that i consumed it productively and made yarn with it” very well and by way of reward he is now in possession of good yarn instead of a bad conscience and as for playing the part of a miser it would never do for him to relapse into such bad ways as that we have seen before to what results such asceticism leads besides where nothing is the king has lost his rights whatever may be the merit of his abstinence there is nothing wherewith specially to remunerate it because the value of the product is merely the sum of the values of the commodities that were thrown into the process of production let him therefore console himself with the reflection that virtue is its own reward but no he becomes importunate he says “the yarn is of no use to me i produced it for sale” in that case let him sell it or still better let him for the future produce only things for satisfying his personal wants a remedy that his physician macculloch has already prescribed as infallible against an epidemic of overproduction he now gets obstinate “can the labourer” he asks “merely with his arms and legs produce commodities out of nothing did i not supply him with the materials by means of which and in which alone his labour could be embodied and as the greater part of society consists of such ne’erdowells have i not rendered society incalculable service by my instruments of production my cotton and my spindle and not only society but the labourer also whom in addition i have provided with the necessaries of life and am i to be allowed nothing in return for all this service” well but has not the labourer rendered him the equivalent service of changing his cotton and spindle into yarn moreover there is here no question of service a service is nothing more than the useful effect of a usevalue be it of a commodity or be it of labour but here we are dealing with exchangevalue the capitalist paid to the labourer a value of shillings and the labourer gave him back an exact equivalent in the value of shillings added by him to the cotton he gave him value for value our friend up to this time so purseproud suddenly assumes the modest demeanour of his own workman and exclaims “have i myself not worked have i not performed the labour of superintendence and of overlooking the spinner and does not this labour too create value” his overlooker and his manager try to hide their smiles meanwhile after a hearty laugh he reassumes his usual mien though he chanted to us the whole creed of the economists in reality he says he would not give a brass farthing for it he leaves this and all such like subterfuges and juggling tricks to the professors of political economy who are paid for it he himself is a practical man and though he does not always consider what he says outside his business yet in his business he knows what he is about let us examine the matter more closely the value of a day’s labourpower amounts to shillings because on our assumption half a day’s labour is embodied in that quantity of labourpower ie because the means of subsistence that are daily required for the production of labourpower cost half a day’s labour but the past labour that is embodied in the labourpower and the living labour that it can call into action the daily cost of maintaining it and its daily expenditure in work are two totally different things the former determines the exchangevalue of the labourpower the latter is its usevalue the fact that half a day’s labour is necessary to keep the labourer alive during hours does not in any way prevent him from working a whole day therefore the value of labourpower and the value which that labourpower creates in the labourprocess are two entirely different magnitudes and this difference of the two values was what the capitalist had in view when he was purchasing the labourpower the useful qualities that labourpower possesses and by virtue of which it makes yarn or boots were to him nothing more than a conditio sine qua non for in order to create value labour must be expended in a useful manner what really influenced him was the specific usevalue which this commodity possesses of being a source not only of value but of more value than it has itself this is the special service that the capitalist expects from labourpower and in this transaction he acts in accordance with the “eternal laws” of the exchange of commodities the seller of labourpower like the seller of any other commodity realises its exchangevalue and parts with its usevalue he cannot take the one without giving the other the usevalue of labourpower or in other words labour belongs just as little to its seller as the usevalue of oil after it has been sold belongs to the dealer who has sold it the owner of the money has paid the value of a day’s labourpower his therefore is the use of it for a day a day’s labour belongs to him the circumstance that on the one hand the daily sustenance of labourpower costs only half a day’s labour while on the other hand the very same labourpower can work during a whole day that consequently the value which its use during one day creates is double what he pays for that use this circumstance is without doubt a piece of good luck for the buyer but by no means an injury to the seller our capitalist foresaw this state of things and that was the cause of his laughter the labourer therefore finds in the workshop the means of production necessary for working not only during six but during twelve hours just as during the six hours’ process our lbs of cotton absorbed six hours’ labour and became lbs of yarn so now lbs of cotton will absorb hours’ labour and be changed into lbs of yarn let us now examine the product of this prolonged process there is now materialised in this lbs of yarn the labour of five days of which four days are due to the cotton and the lost steel of the spindle the remaining day having been absorbed by the cotton during the spinning process expressed in gold the labour of five days is thirty shillings this is therefore the price of the lbs of yarn giving as before eighteenpence as the price of a pound but the sum of the values of the commodities that entered into the process amounts to shillings the value of the yarn is shillings therefore the value of the product is greater than the value advanced for its production shillings have been transformed into shillings a surplusvalue of shillings has been created the trick has at last succeeded money has been converted into capital every condition of the problem is satisfied while the laws that regulate the exchange of commodities have been in no way violated equivalent has been exchanged for equivalent for the capitalist as buyer paid for each commodity for the cotton the spindle and the labourpower its full value he then did what is done by every purchaser of commodities he consumed their usevalue the consumption of the labourpower which was also the process of producing commodities resulted in lbs of yarn having a value of shillings the capitalist formerly a buyer now returns to market as a seller of commodities he sells his yarn at eighteenpence a pound which is its exact value yet for all that he withdraws shillings more from circulation than he originally threw into it this metamorphosis this conversion of money into capital takes place both within the sphere of circulation and also outside it within the circulation because conditioned by the purchase of the labourpower in the market outside the circulation because what is done within it is only a steppingstone to the production of surplusvalue a process which is entirely confined to the sphere of production thus “tout est pour le mieux dans le meilleur des mondes possibles” “everything is for the best in the best of all possible worlds” – voltaire candide by turning his money into commodities that serve as the material elements of a new product and as factors in the labourprocess by incorporating living labour with their dead substance the capitalist at the same time converts value ie past materialised and dead labour into capital into value big with value a live monster that is fruitful and multiplies if we now compare the two processes of producing value and of creating surplusvalue we see that the latter is nothing but the continuation of the former beyond a definite point if on the one hand the process be not carried beyond the point where the value paid by the capitalist for the labourpower is replaced by an exact equivalent it is simply a process of producing value if on the other hand it be continued beyond that point it becomes a process of creating surplusvalue if we proceed further and compare the process of producing value with the labourprocess pure and simple we find that the latter consists of the useful labour the work that produces usevalues here we contemplate the labour as producing a particular article we view it under its qualitative aspect alone with regard to its end and aim but viewed as a valuecreating process the same labourprocess presents itself under its quantitative aspect alone here it is a question merely of the time occupied by the labourer in doing the work of the period during which the labourpower is usefully expended here the commodities that take part in the process do not count any longer as necessary adjuncts of labourpower in the production of a definite useful object they count merely as depositories of so much absorbed or materialised labour that labour whether previously embodied in the means of production or incorporated in them for the first time during the process by the action of labourpower counts in either case only according to its duration it amounts to so many hours or days as the case may be moreover only so much of the time spent in the production of any article is counted as under the given social conditions is necessary the consequences of this are various in the first place it becomes necessary that the labour should be carried on under normal conditions if a selfacting mule is the implement in general use for spinning it would be absurd to supply the spinner with a distaff and spinning wheel the cotton too must not be such rubbish as to cause extra waste in being worked but must be of suitable quality otherwise the spinner would be found to spend more time in producing a pound of yarn than is socially necessary in which case the excess of time would create neither value nor money but whether the material factors of the process are of normal quality or not depends not upon the labourer but entirely upon the capitalist then again the labourpower itself must be of average efficacy in the trade in which it is being employed it must possess the average skill handiness and quickness prevalent in that trade and our capitalist took good care to buy labourpower of such normal goodness this power must be applied with the average amount of exertion and with the usual degree of intensity and the capitalist is as careful to see that this is done as that his workmen are not idle for a single moment he has bought the use of the labourpower for a definite period and he insists upon his rights he has no intention of being robbed lastly and for this purpose our friend has a penal code of his own all wasteful consumption of raw material or instruments of labour is strictly forbidden because what is so wasted represents labour superfluously expended labour that does not count in the product or enter into its value we now see that the difference between labour considered on the one hand as producing utilities and on the other hand as creating value a difference which we discovered by our analysis of a commodity resolves itself into a distinction between two aspects of the process of production the process of production considered on the one hand as the unity of the labourprocess and the process of creating value is production of commodities considered on the other hand as the unity of the labourprocess and the process of producing surplusvalue it is the capitalist process of production or capitalist production of commodities we stated on a previous page that in the creation of surplusvalue it does not in the least matter whether the labour appropriated by the capitalist be simple unskilled labour of average quality or more complicated skilled labour all labour of a higher or more complicated character than average labour is expenditure of labourpower of a more costly kind labourpower whose production has cost more time and labour and which therefore has a higher value than unskilled or simple labourpower this power being highervalue its consumption is labour of a higher class labour that creates in equal times proportionally higher values than unskilled labour does whatever difference in skill there may be between the labour of a spinner and that of a jeweller the portion of his labour by which the jeweller merely replaces the value of his own labourpower does not in any way differ in quality from the additional portion by which he creates surplusvalue in the making of jewellery just as in spinning the surplusvalue results only from a quantitative excess of labour from a lengtheningout of one and the same labourprocess in the one case of the process of making jewels in the other of the process of making yarn but on the other hand in every process of creating value the reduction of skilled labour to average social labour eg one day of skilled to six days of unskilled labour is unavoidable we therefore save ourselves a superfluous operation and simplify our analysis by the assumption that the labour of the workman employed by the capitalist is unskilled average labour chapter constant capital and variable capital the various factors of the labourprocess play different parts in forming the value of the product the labourer adds fresh value to the subject of his labour by expending upon it a given amount of additional labour no matter what the specific character and utility of that labour may be on the other hand the values of the means of production used up in the process are preserved and present themselves afresh as constituent parts of the value of the product the values of the cotton and the spindle for instance reappear again in the value of the yarn the value of the means of production is therefore preserved by being transferred to the product this transfer takes place during the conversion of those means into a product or in other words during the labourprocess it is brought about by labour but how the labourer does not perform two operations at once one in order to add value to the cotton the other in order to preserve the value of the means of production or what amounts to the same thing to transfer to the yarn to the product the value of the cotton on which he works and part of the value of the spindle with which he works but by the very act of adding new value he preserves their former values since however the addition of new value to the subject of his labour and the preservation of its former value are two entirely distinct results produced simultaneously by the labourer during one operation it is plain that this twofold nature of the result can be explained only by the twofold nature of his labour at one and the same time it must in one character create value and in another character preserve or transfer value now in what manner does every labourer add new labour and consequently new value evidently only by labouring productively in a particular way the spinner by spinning the weaver by weaving the smith by forging but while thus incorporating labour generally that is value it is by the particular form alone of the labour by the spinning the weaving and the forging respectively that the means of production the cotton and spindle the yarn and loom and the iron and anvil become constituent elements of the product of a new usevalue each usevalue disappears but only to reappear under a new form in a new usevalue now we saw when we were considering the process of creating value that if a usevalue be effectively consumed in the production of a new usevalue the quantity of labour expended in the production of the consumed article forms a portion of the quantity of labour necessary to produce the new usevalue this portion is therefore labour transferred from the means of production to the new product hence the labourer preserves the values of the consumed means of production or transfers them as portions of its value to the product not by virtue of his additional labour abstractedly considered but by virtue of the particular useful character of that labour by virtue of its special productive form in so far then as labour is such specific productive activity in so far as it is spinning weaving or forging it raises by mere contact the means of production from the dead makes them living factors of the labourprocess and combines with them to form the new products if the special productive labour of the workman were not spinning he could not convert the cotton into yarn and therefore could not transfer the values of the cotton and spindle to the yarn suppose the same workman were to change his occupation to that of a joiner he would still by a day’s labour add value to the material he works upon consequently we see first that the addition of new value takes place not by virtue of his labour being spinning in particular or joinering in particular but because it is labour in the abstract a portion of the total labour of society and we see next that the value added is of a given definite amount not because his labour has a special utility but because it is exerted for a definite time on the one hand then it is by virtue of its general character as being expenditure of human labourpower in the abstract that spinning adds new value to the values of the cotton and the spindle and on the other hand it is by virtue of its special character as being a concrete useful process that the same labour of spinning both transfers the values of the means of production to the product and preserves them in the product hence at one and the same time there is produced a twofold result by the simple addition of a certain quantity of labour new value is added and by the quality of this added labour the original values of the means of production are preserved in the product this twofold effect resulting from the twofold character of labour may be traced in various phenomena let us assume that some invention enables the spinner to spin as much cotton in hours as he was able to spin before in hours his labour is now six times as effective as it was for the purposes of useful production the product of hours’ work has increased sixfold from lbs to lbs but now the lbs of cotton absorb only the same amount of labour as formerly did the lbs onesixth as much new labour is absorbed by each pound of cotton and consequently the value added by the labour to each pound is only onesixth of what it formerly was on the other hand in the product in the lbs of yarn the value transferred from the cotton is six times as great as before by the hours’ spinning the value of the raw material preserved and transferred to the product is six times as great as before although the new value added by the labour of the spinner to each pound of the very same raw material is onesixth what it was formerly this shows that the two properties of labour by virtue of which it is enabled in one case to preserve value and in the other to create value are essentially different on the one hand the longer the time necessary to spin a given weight of cotton into yarn the greater is the new value added to the material on the other hand the greater the weight of the cotton spun in a given time the greater is the value preserved by being transferred from it to the product let us now assume that the productiveness of the spinner’s labour instead of varying remains constant that he therefore requires the same time as he formerly did to convert one pound of cotton into yarn but that the exchangevalue of the cotton varies either by rising to six times its former value or falling to onesixth of that value in both these cases the spinner puts the same quantity of labour into a pound of cotton and therefore adds as much value as he did before the change in the value he also produces a given weight of yarn in the same time as he did before nevertheless the value that he transfers from the cotton to the yarn is either onesixth of what it was before the variation or as the case may be six times as much as before the same result occurs when the value of the instruments of labour rises or falls while their useful efficacy in the process remains unaltered again if the technical conditions of the spinning process remain unchanged and no change of value takes place in the means of production the spinner continues to consume in equal workingtimes equal quantities of raw material and equal quantities of machinery of unvarying value the value that he preserves in the product is directly proportional to the new value that he adds to the product in two weeks he incorporates twice as much labour and therefore twice as much value as in one week and during the same time he consumes twice as much material and wears out twice as much machinery of double the value in each case he therefore preserves in the product of two weeks twice as much value as in the product of one week so long as the conditions of production remain the same the more value the labourer adds by fresh labour the more value he transfers and preserves but he does so merely because this addition of new value takes place under conditions that have not varied and are independent of his own labour of course it may be said in one sense that the labourer preserves old value always in proportion to the quantity of new value that he adds whether the value of cotton rise from one shilling to two shillings or fall to sixpence the workman invariably preserves in the product of one hour only one half as much value as he preserves in two hours in like manner if the productiveness of his own labour varies by rising or falling he will in one hour spin either more or less cotton as the case may be than he did before and will consequently preserve in the product of one hour more or less value of cotton but all the same he will preserve by two hours’ labour twice as much value as he will by one value exists only in articles of utility in objects we leave out of consideration its purely symbolical representation by tokens man himself viewed as the impersonation of labourpower is a natural object a thing although a living conscious thing and labour is the manifestation of this power residing in him if therefore an article loses its utility it also loses its value the reason why means of production do not lose their value at the same time that they lose their usevalue is this they lose in the labourprocess the original form of their usevalue only to assume in the product the form of a new usevalue but however important it may be to value that it should have some object of utility to embody itself in yet it is a matter of complete indifference what particular object serves this purpose this we saw when treating of the metamorphosis of commodities hence it follows that in the labourprocess the means of production transfer their value to the product only so far as along with their usevalue they lose also their exchangevalue they give up to the product that value alone which they themselves lose as means of production but in this respect the material factors of the labourprocess do not all behave alike the coal burnt under the boiler vanishes without leaving a trace so too the tallow with which the axles of wheels are greased dye stuffs and other auxiliary substances also vanish but reappear as properties of the product raw material forms the substance of the product but only after it has changed its form hence raw material and auxiliary substances lose the characteristic form with which they are clothed on entering the labourprocess it is otherwise with the instruments of labour tools machines workshops and vessels are of use in the labourprocess only so long as they retain their original shape and are ready each morning to renew the process with their shape unchanged and just as during their lifetime that is to say during the continued labourprocess in which they serve they retain their shape independent of the product so too they do after their death the corpses of machines tools workshops c are always separate and distinct from the product they helped to turn out if we now consider the case of any instrument of labour during the whole period of its service from the day of its entry into the workshop till the day of its banishment into the lumber room we find that during this period its usevalue has been completely consumed and therefore its exchangevalue completely transferred to the product for instance if a spinning machine lasts for years it is plain that during that working period its total value is gradually transferred to the product of the years the lifetime of an instrument of labour therefore is spent in the repetition of a greater or less number of similar operations its life may be compared with that of a human being every day brings a man hours nearer to his grave but how many days he has still to travel on that road no man can tell accurately by merely looking at him this difficulty however does not prevent life insurance offices from drawing by means of the theory of averages very accurate and at the same time very profitable conclusions so it is with the instruments of labour it is known by experience how long on the average a machine of a particular kind will last suppose its usevalue in the labourprocess to last only six days then on the average it loses each day onesixth of its usevalue and therefore parts with onesixth of its value to the daily product the wear and tear of all instruments their daily loss of usevalue and the corresponding quantity of value they part with to the product are accordingly calculated upon this basis it is thus strikingly clear that means of production never transfer more value to the product than they themselves lose during the labourprocess by the destruction of their own usevalue if such an instrument has no value to lose if in other words it is not the product of human labour it transfers no value to the product it helps to create usevalue without contributing to the formation of exchangevalue in this class are included all means of production supplied by nature without human assistance such as land wind water metals in situ and timber in virgin forests yet another interesting phenomenon here presents itself suppose a machine to be worth £ and to wear out in days then one thousandth part of the value of the machine is daily transferred to the day’s product at the same time though with diminishing vitality the machine as a whole continues to take part in the labourprocess thus it appears that one factor of the labourprocess a means of production continually enters as a whole into that process while it enters into the process of the formation of value by fractions only the difference between the two processes is here reflected in their material factors by the same instrument of production taking part as a whole in the labourprocess while at the same time as an element in the formation of value it enters only by fractions on the other hand a means of production may take part as a whole in the formation of value while into the labourprocess it enters only bit by bit suppose that in spinning cotton the waste for every lbs used amounts to lbs which is converted not into yarn but into “devil’s dust” now although this lbs of cotton never becomes a constituent element of the yarn yet assuming this amount of waste to be normal and inevitable under average conditions of spinning its value is just as surely transferred to the value of the yarn as is the value of the lbs that form the substance of the yarn the usevalue of lbs of cotton must vanish into dust before lbs of yarn can be made the destruction of this cotton is therefore a necessary condition in the production of the yarn and because it is a necessary condition and for no other reason the value of that cotton is transferred to the product the same holds good for every kind of refuse resulting from a labourprocess so far at least as such refuse cannot be further employed as a means in the production of new and independent usevalues such an employment of refuse may be seen in the large machine works at manchester where mountains of iron turnings are carted away to the foundry in the evening in order the next morning to reappear in the workshops as solid masses of iron we have seen that the means of production transfer value to the new product so far only as during the labourprocess they lose value in the shape of their old usevalue the maximum loss of value that they can suffer in the process is plainly limited by the amount of the original value with which they came into the process or in other words by the labourtime necessary for their production therefore the means of production can never add more value to the product than they themselves possess independently of the process in which they assist however useful a given kind of raw material or a machine or other means of production may be though it may cost £ or say days’ labour yet it cannot under any circumstances add to the value of the product more than £ its value is determined not by the labourprocess into which it enters as a means of production but by that out of which it has issued as a product in the labourprocess it only serves as a mere usevalue a thing with useful properties and could not therefore transfer any value to the product unless it possessed such value previously while productive labour is changing the means of production into constituent elements of a new product their value undergoes a metempsychosis it deserts the consumed body to occupy the newly created one but this transmigration takes place as it were behind the back of the labourer he is unable to add new labour to create new value without at the same time preserving old values and this because the labour he adds must be of a specific useful kind and he cannot do work of a useful kind without employing products as the means of production of a new product and thereby transferring their value to the new product the property therefore which labourpower in action living labour possesses of preserving value at the same time that it adds it is a gift of nature which costs the labourer nothing but which is very advantageous to the capitalist inasmuch as it preserves the existing value of his capital so long as trade is good the capitalist is too much absorbed in moneygrubbing to take notice of this gratuitous gift of labour a violent interruption of the labourprocess by a crisis makes him sensitively aware of it as regards the means of production what is really consumed is their usevalue and the consumption of this usevalue by labour results in the product there is no consumption of their value and it would therefore be inaccurate to say that it is reproduced it is rather preserved not by reason of any operation it undergoes itself in the process but because the article in which it originally exists vanishes it is true but vanishes into some other article hence in the value of the product there is a reappearance of the value of the means of production but there is strictly speaking no reproduction of that value that which is produced is a new usevalue in which the old exchangevalue reappears it is otherwise with the subjective factor of the labourprocess with labourpower in action while the labourer by virtue of his labour being of a specialised kind that has a special object preserves and transfers to the product the value of the means of production he at the same time by the mere act of working creates each instant an additional or new value suppose the process of production to be stopped just when the workman has produced an equivalent for the value of his own labourpower when for example by six hours’ labour he has added a value of three shillings this value is the surplus of the total value of the product over the portion of its value that is due to the means of production it is the only original bit of value formed during this process the only portion of the value of the product created by this process of course we do not forget that this new value only replaces the money advanced by the capitalist in the purchase of the labourpower and spent by the labourer on the necessaries of life with regard to the money spent the new value is merely a reproduction but nevertheless it is an actual and not as in the case of the value of the means of production only an apparent reproduction the substitution of one value for another is here effected by the creation of new value we know however from what has gone before that the labourprocess may continue beyond the time necessary to reproduce and incorporate in the product a mere equivalent for the value of the labourpower instead of the six hours that are sufficient for the latter purpose the process may continue for twelve hours the action of labourpower therefore not only reproduces its own value but produces value over and above it this surplusvalue is the difference between the value of the product and the value of the elements consumed in the formation of that product in other words of the means of production and the labourpower by our explanation of the different parts played by the various factors of the labourprocess in the formation of the product’s value we have in fact disclosed the characters of the different functions allotted to the different elements of capital in the process of expanding its own value the surplus of the total value of the product over the sum of the values of its constituent factors is the surplus of the expanded capital over the capital originally advanced the means of production on the one hand labourpower on the other are merely the different modes of existence which the value of the original capital assumed when from being money it was transformed into the various factors of the labourprocess that part of capital then which is represented by the means of production by the raw material auxiliary material and the instruments of labour does not in the process of production undergo any quantitative alteration of value i therefore call it the constant part of capital or more shortly constant capital on the other hand that part of capital represented by labourpower does in the process of production undergo an alteration of value it both reproduces the equivalent of its own value and also produces an excess a surplusvalue which may itself vary may be more or less according to circumstances this part of capital is continually being transformed from a constant into a variable magnitude i therefore call it the variable part of capital or shortly variable capital the same elements of capital which from the point of view of the labourprocess present themselves respectively as the objective and subjective factors as means of production and labourpower present themselves from the point of view of the process of creating surplusvalue as constant and variable capital the definition of constant capital given above by no means excludes the possibility of a change of value in its elements suppose the price of cotton to be one day sixpence a pound and the next day in consequence of a failure of the cotton crop a shilling a pound each pound of the cotton bought at sixpence and worked up after the rise in value transfers to the product a value of one shilling and the cotton already spun before the rise and perhaps circulating in the market as yarn likewise transfers to the product twice its original value it is plain however that these changes of value are independent of the increment or surplusvalue added to the value of the cotton by the spinning itself if the old cotton had never been spun it could after the rise be resold at a shilling a pound instead of at sixpence further the fewer the processes the cotton has gone through the more certain is this result we therefore find that speculators make it a rule when such sudden changes in value occur to speculate in that material on which the least possible quantity of labour has been spent to speculate therefore in yarn rather than in cloth in cotton itself rather than in yarn the change of value in the case we have been considering originates not in the process in which the cotton plays the part of a means of production and in which it therefore functions as constant capital but in the process in which the cotton itself is produced the value of a commodity it is true is determined by the quantity of labour contained in it but this quantity is itself limited by social conditions if the time socially necessary for the production of any commodity alters – and a given weight of cotton represents after a bad harvest more labour than after a good one – all previously existing commodities of the same class are affected because they are as it were only individuals of the species and their value at any given time is measured by the labour socially necessary ie by the labour necessary for their production under the then existing social conditions as the value of the raw material may change so too may that of the instruments of labour of the machinery c employed in the process and consequently that portion of the value of the product transferred to it from them may also change if in consequence of a new invention machinery of a particular kind can be produced by a diminished expenditure of labour the old machinery becomes depreciated more or less and consequently transfers so much less value to the product but here again the change in value originates outside the process in which the machine is acting as a means of production once engaged in this process the machine cannot transfer more value than it possesses apart from the process just as a change in the value of the means of production even after they have commenced to take a part in the labourprocess does not alter their character as constant capital so too a change in the proportion of constant to variable capital does not affect the respective functions of these two kinds of capital the technical conditions of the labourprocess may be revolutionised to such an extent that where formerly ten men using ten implements of small value worked up a relatively small quantity of raw material one man may now with the aid of one expensive machine work up one hundred times as much raw material in the latter case we have an enormous increase in the constant capital that is represented by the total value of the means of production used and at the same time a great reduction in the variable capital invested in labourpower such a revolution however alters only the quantitative relation between the constant and the variable capital or the proportions in which the total capital is split up into its constant and variable constituents it has not in the least degree affected the essential difference between the two chapter the rate of surplusvalue section the degree of exploitation of labourpower the surplusvalue generated in the process of production by c the capital advanced or in other words the selfexpansion of the value of the capital c presents itself for our consideration in the first place as a surplus as the amount by which the value of the product exceeds the value of its constituent elements the capital c is made up of two components one the sum of money c laid out upon the means of production and the other the sum of money v expended upon the labourpower c represents the portion that has become constant capital and v the portion that has become variable capital at first then c c v for example if £ is the capital advanced its components may be such that the £ £ const £ var when the process of production is finished we get a commodity whose value c v s where s is the surplusvalue or taking our former figures the value of this commodity may be £ const £ var £ surpl the original capital has now changed from c to c from £ to £ the difference is s or a surplusvalue of £ since the value of the constituent elements of the product is equal to the value of the advanced capital it is mere tautology to say that the excess of the value of the product over the value of its constituent elements is equal to the expansion of the capital advanced or to the surplusvalue produced nevertheless we must examine this tautology a little more closely the two things compared are the value of the product and the value of its constituents consumed in the process of production now we have seen how that portion of the constant capital which consists of the instruments of labour transfers to the production only a fraction of its value while the remainder of that value continues to reside in those instruments since this remainder plays no part in the formation of value we may at present leave it on one side to introduce it into the calculation would make no difference for instance taking our former example c £ suppose this sum to consist of £ value of raw material £ value of auxiliary material and £ value of the machinery worn away in the process and suppose that the total value of the machinery employed is £ out of this latter sum then we reckon as advanced for the purpose of turning out the product the sum of £ alone which the machinery loses by wear and tear in the process for this is all it parts with to the product now if we also reckon the remaining £ which still continues in the machinery as transferred to the product we ought also to reckon it as part of the value advanced and thus make it appear on both sides of our calculation we should in this way get £ on one side and £ on the other the difference of these two sums or the surplusvalue would still be £ throughout this book therefore by constant capital advanced for the production of value we always mean unless the context is repugnant thereto the value of the means of production actually consumed in the process and that value alone this being so let us return to the formula c c v which we saw was transformed into c c v s c becoming c we know that the value of the constant capital is transferred to and merely reappears in the product the new value actually created in the process the value produced or valueproduct is therefore not the same as the value of the product it is not as it would at first sight appear c v s or £ const £ var £ surpl but v s or £ var £ surpl not £ but £ if c or in other words if there were branches of industry in which the capitalist could dispense with all means of production made by previous labour whether they be raw material auxiliary material or instruments of labour employing only labourpower and materials supplied by nature in that case there would be no constant capital to transfer to the product this component of the value of the product ie the £ in our example would be eliminated but the sum of £ the amount of new value created or the value produced which contains £ of surplusvalue would remain just as great as if c represented the highest value imaginable we should have c v v or c the expanded capital v s and therefore c c s as before on the other hand if s or in other words if the labourpower whose value is advanced in the form of variable capital were to produce only its equivalent we should have c c v or c the value of the product c v or c c the capital advanced would in this case not have expanded its value from what has gone before we know that surplusvalue is purely the result of a variation in the value of v of that portion of the capital which is transformed into labourpower consequently v s v v or v plus an increment of v but the fact that it is v alone that varies and the conditions of that variation are obscured by the circumstance that in consequence of the increase in the variable component of the capital there is also an increase in the sum total of the advanced capital it was originally £ and becomes £ therefore in order that our investigation may lead to accurate results we must make abstraction from that portion of the value of the product in which constant capital alone appears and consequently must equate the constant capital to zero or make c this is merely an application of a mathematical rule employed whenever we operate with constant and variable magnitudes related to each other by the symbols of addition and subtraction only a further difficulty is caused by the original form of the variable capital in our example c £ const £ var £ surpl but £ is a given and therefore a constant quantity hence it appears absurd to treat it as variable but in fact the term £ var is here merely a symbol to show that this value undergoes a process the portion of the capital invested in the purchase of labourpower is a definite quantity of materialised labour a constant value like the value of the labourpower purchased but in the process of production the place of the £ is taken by the labourpower in action dead labour is replaced by living labour something stagnant by something flowing a constant by a variable the result is the reproduction of v plus an increment of v from the point of view then of capitalist production the whole process appears as the spontaneous variation of the originally constant value which is transformed into labourpower both the process and its result appear to be owing to this value if therefore such expressions as “£ variable capital” or “so much selfexpanding value” appear contradictory this is only because they bring to the surface a contradiction immanent in capitalist production at first sight it appears a strange proceeding to equate the constant capital to zero yet it is what we do every day if for example we wish to calculate the amount of england’s profits from the cotton industry we first of all deduct the sums paid for cotton to the united states india egypt and other countries in other words the value of the capital that merely reappears in the value of the product is put of course the ratio of surplusvalue not only to that portion of the capital from which it immediately springs and whose change of value it represents but also to the sum total of the capital advanced is economically of very great importance we shall therefore in the third book treat of this ratio exhaustively in order to enable one portion of a capital to expand its value by being converted into labourpower it is necessary that another portion be converted into means of production in order that variable capital may perform its function constant capital must be advanced in proper proportion a proportion given by the special technical conditions of each labourprocess the circumstance however that retorts and other vessels are necessary to a chemical process does not compel the chemist to notice them in the result of his analysis if we look at the means of production in their relation to the creation of value and to the variation in the quantity of value apart from anything else they appear simply as the material in which labourpower the valuecreator incorporates itself neither the nature nor the value of this material is of any importance the only requisite is that there be a sufficient supply to absorb the labour expended in the process of production that supply once given the material may rise or fall in value or even be as land and the sea without any value in itself but this will have no influence on the creation of value or on the variation in the quantity of value in the first place then we equate the constant capital to zero the capital advanced is consequently reduced from c v to v and instead of the value of the product c v s we have now the value produced v s given the new value produced £ which sum consequently represents the whole labour expended during the process then subtracting from it £ the value of the variable capital we have remaining £ the amount of the surplusvalue this sum of £ or s expresses the absolute quantity of surplusvalue produced the relative quantity produced or the increase per cent of the variable capital is determined it is plain by the ratio of the surplusvalue to the variable capital or is expressed by sv in our example this ratio is which gives an increase of this relative increase in the value of the variable capital or the relative magnitude of the surplusvalue i call “the rate of surplusvalue” we have seen that the labourer during one portion of the labourprocess produces only the value of his labourpower that is the value of his means of subsistence now since his work forms part of a system based on the social division of labour he does not directly produce the actual necessaries which he himself consumes he produces instead a particular commodity yarn for example whose value is equal to the value of those necessaries or of the money with which they can be bought the portion of his day’s labour devoted to this purpose will be greater or less in proportion to the value of the necessaries that he daily requires on an average or what amounts to the same thing in proportion to the labourtime required on an average to produce them if the value of those necessaries represent on an average the expenditure of six hours’ labour the workman must on an average work for six hours to produce that value if instead of working for the capitalist he worked independently on his own account he would other things being equal still be obliged to labour for the same number of hours in order to produce the value of his labourpower and thereby to gain the means of subsistence necessary for his conservation or continued reproduction but as we have seen during that portion of his day’s labour in which he produces the value of his labourpower say three shillings he produces only an equivalent for the value of his labourpower already advanced by the capitalist the new value created only replaces the variable capital advanced it is owing to this fact that the production of the new value of three shillings takes the semblance of a mere reproduction that portion of the working day then during which this reproduction takes place i call “necessary” labour time and the labour expended during that time i call “necessary” labour necessary as regards the labourer because independent of the particular social form of his labour necessary as regards capital and the world of capitalists because on the continued existence of the labourer depends their existence also during the second period of the labourprocess that in which his labour is no longer necessary labour the workman it is true labours expends labourpower but his labour being no longer necessary labour he creates no value for himself he creates surplusvalue which for the capitalist has all the charms of a creation out of nothing this portion of the working day i name surplus labourtime and to the labour expended during that time i give the name of surplus labour it is every bit as important for a correct understanding of surplusvalue to conceive it as a mere congelation of surplus labourtime as nothing but materialised surplus labour as it is for a proper comprehension of value to conceive it as a mere congelation of so many hours of labour as nothing but materialised labour the essential difference between the various economic forms of society between for instance a society based on slavelabour and one based on wagelabour lies only in the mode in which this surplus labour is in each case extracted from the actual producer the labourer since on the one hand the values of the variable capital and of the labourpower purchased by that capital are equal and the value of this labourpower determines the necessary portion of the working day and since on the other hand the surplusvalue is determined by the surplus portion of the working day it follows that surplusvalue bears the same ratio to variable capital that surplus labour does to necessary labour or in other words the rate of surplusvalue sv surplus labournecessary labour both ratios sv and surplus labournecessary labour express the same thing in different ways in the one case by reference to materialised incorporated labour in the other by reference to living fluent labour the rate of surplusvalue is therefore an exact expression for the degree of exploitation of labourpower by capital or of the labourer by the capitalist we assumed in our example that the value of the product £ const £ var £ surpl and that the capital advanced £ since the surplusvalue £ and the advanced capital £ we should according to the usual way of reckoning get as the rate of surplusvalue generally confounded with rate of profits a rate so low as possibly to cause a pleasant surprise to mr carey and other harmonisers but in truth the rate of surplusvalue is not equal to sc or scv but to sv thus it is not but or which is more than five times the apparent degree of exploitation although in the case we have supposed we are ignorant of the actual length of the working day and of the duration in days or weeks of the labourprocess as also of the number of labourers employed yet the rate of surplusvalue sv accurately discloses to us by means of its equivalent expression surplus labournecessary labour the relation between the two parts of the working day this relation is here one of equality the rate being hence it is plain the labourer in our example works one half of the day for himself the other half for the capitalist the method of calculating the rate of surplusvalue is therefore shortly as follows we take the total value of the product and put the constant capital which merely reappears in it equal to zero what remains is the only value that has in the process of producing the commodity been actually created if the amount of surplusvalue be given we have only to deduct it from this remainder to find the variable capital and vice versâ if the latter be given and we require to find the surplusvalue if both be given we have only to perform the concluding operation viz to calculate sv the ratio of the surplusvalue to the variable capital though the method is so simple yet it may not be amiss by means of a few examples to exercise the reader in the application of the novel principles underlying it first we will take the case of a spinning mill containing mule spindles spinning no yarn from american cotton and producing lb of yarn weekly per spindle we assume the waste to be under these circumstances lbs of cotton are consumed weekly of which lbs go to waste the price of the cotton in april was ¾d per lb the raw material therefore costs in round numbers £ the spindles including preparationmachinery and motive power cost we will assume £ per spindle amounting to a total of £ the wear and tear we put at or £ yearly £ weekly the rent of the building we suppose to be £ a year or £ a week coal consumed for horsepower indicated at lbs of coal per horsepower per hour during hours and inclusive of that consumed in heating the mill tons a week at s d a ton amounts to about £ ½ a week gas £ a week oil c £ ½ a week total cost of the above auxiliary materials £ weekly therefore the constant portion of the value of the week’s product is £ wages amount to £ a week the price of the yarn is ¼d per lb which gives for the value of lbs the sum of £ the surplusvalue is therefore in this case £ £ £ we put the constant part of the value of the product as it plays no part in the creation of value there remains £ as the weekly value created which £ var £ surpl the rate of surplusvalue is therefore in a working day of hours with average labour the result is necessary labour hours and surplus labour one more example jacob gives the following calculation for the year owing to the previous adjustment of several items it is very imperfect nevertheless for our purpose it is sufficient in it he assumes the price of wheat to be s a quarter and the average yield per acre to be bushels value produced per acre seed £ s d tithes rates and taxes £ s d manure £ s d rent £ s d wages £ s d farmer’s profit and interest £ s d total £ s d total £ s d assuming that the price of the product is the same as its value we here find the surplusvalue distributed under the various heads of profit interest rent c we have nothing to do with these in detail we simply add them together and the sum is a surplusvalue of £ s d the sum of £ s d paid for seed and manure is constant capital and we put it equal to zero there is left the sum of £ s d which is the variable capital advanced and we see that a new value of £ s d £ s d has been produced in its place therefore sv £ s d £ s d giving a rate of surplusvalue of more than the labourer employs more than one half of his working day in producing the surplusvalue which different persons under different pretexts share amongst themselves section the representation of the components of the value of the product by corresponding proportional parts of the product itself let us now return to the example by which we were shown how the capitalist converts money into capital the product of a working day of hours is lbs of yarn having a value of s no less than ths of this value or s is due to mere reappearance in it of the value of the means of production lbs of cotton value s and spindle worn away s it is therefore constant capital the remaining ths or s is the new value created during the spinning process of this one half replaces the value of the day’s labourpower or the variable capital the remaining half constitutes a surplusvalue of s the total value then of the lbs of yarn is made up as follows s value of yarn s const s var s surpl since the whole of this value is contained in the lbs of yarn produced it follows that the various component parts of this value can be represented as being contained respectively in corresponding parts of the product if the value of s is contained in lbs of yarn then ths of this value or the s that form its constant part is contained in ths of the product or in lbs of yarn of the latter lbs represent the value of the raw material the s worth of cotton spun and lbs represent the s worth of spindle c worn away in the process hence the whole of the cotton used up in spinning the lbs of yarn is represented by lbs of yarn this latter weight of yarn contains it is true by weight no more than lbs of cotton worth shillings but the shillings additional value contained in it are the equivalent for the cotton consumed in spinning the remaining lbs of yarn the effect is the same as if these lbs of yarn contained no cotton at all and the whole lbs of cotton were concentrated in the lbs of yarn the latter weight on the other hand does not contain an atom either of the value of the auxiliary materials and implements or of the value newly created in the process in the same way the lbs of yarn in which the s the remainder of the constant capital is embodied represents nothing but the value of the auxiliary materials and instruments of labour consumed in producing the lbs of yarn we have therefore arrived at this result although eighttenths of the product or lbs of yarn is in its character of an article of utility just as much the fabric of the spinner’s labour as the remainder of the same product yet when viewed in this connexion it does not contain and has not absorbed any labour expended during the process of spinning it is just as if the cotton had converted itself into yarn without help as if the shape it had assumed was mere trickery and deceit for so soon as our capitalist sells it for s and with the money replaces his means of production it becomes evident that this lbs of yarn is nothing more than so much cotton and spindlewaste in disguise on the other hand the remaining ths of the product or lbs of yarn represent nothing but the new value of s created during the hours’ spinning process all the value transferred to those lbs from the raw material and instruments of labour consumed was so to say intercepted in order to be incorporated in the lbs first spun in this case it is as if the spinner had spun lbs of yarn out of air or as if he had spun them with the aid of cotton and spindles that being the spontaneous gift of nature transferred no value to the product of this lbs of yarn in which the whole of the value newly created during the process is condensed one half represents the equivalent for the value of the labour consumed or the s variable capital the other half represents the s surplusvalue since workinghours of the spinner are embodied in s it follows that in yarn of the value of s there must be embodied workinghours and this quantity of labourtime does in fact exist in the lbs of yarn for in ths or lbs there are materialised the hours of labour expended before the commencement of the spinning process on the means of production and in the remaining ths or lbs there are materialised the hours’ work done during the process itself on a former page we saw that the value of the yarn is equal to the sum of the new value created during the production of that yarn plus the value previously existing in the means of production it has now been shown how the various component parts of the value of the product parts that differ functionally from each other may be represented by corresponding proportional parts of the product itself to split up in this manner the product into different parts of which one represents only the labour previously spent on the means of production or the constant capital another only the necessary labour spent during the process of production or the variable capital and another and last part only the surplus labour expended during the same process or the surplusvalue to do this is as will be seen later on from its application to complicated and hitherto unsolved problems no less important than it is simple in the preceding investigation we have treated the total product as the final result ready for use of a working day of hours we can however follow this total product through all the stages of its production and in this way we shall arrive at the same result as before if we represent the partial products given off at the different stages as functionally different parts of the final or total product the spinner produces in hours lbs of yarn or in hour ⅔ lbs consequently he produces in hours ⅔ lbs or a partial product equal in value to all the cotton that is spun in a whole day in like manner the partial product of the next period of hour and minutes is ⅔ lbs of yarn this represents the value of the instruments of labour that are consumed in hours in the following hour and minutes the spinner produces lbs of yarn worth shillings a value equal to the whole value he creates in his hours’ necessary labour finally in the last hour and minutes he produces another lbs of yarn whose value is equal to the surplusvalue created by his surplus labour during half a day this method of calculation serves the english manufacturer for everyday use it shows he will say that in the first hours or ⅔ of the working day he gets back the value of his cotton and so on for the remaining hours it is also a perfectly correct method being in fact the first method given above with this difference that instead of being applied to space in which the different parts of the completed product lie side by side it deals with time in which those parts are successively produced but it can also be accompanied by very barbarian notions more especially in the heads of those who are as much interested practically in the process of making value beget value as they are in misunderstanding that process theoretically such people may get the notion into their heads that our spinner for example produces or replaces in the first hours of his working day the value of the cotton in the following hour and minutes the value of the instruments of labour worn away in the next hour and minutes the value of the wages and that he devotes to the production of surplusvalue for the manufacturer only that well known “last hour” in this way the poor spinner is made to perform the twofold miracle not only of producing cotton spindles steamengine coal oil c at the same time that he spins with them but also of turning one working day into five for in the example we are considering the production of the raw material and instruments of labour demands four working days of twelve hours each and their conversion into yarn requires another such day that the love of lucre induces an easy belief in such miracles and that sycophant doctrinaires are never wanting to prove them is vouched for by the following incident of historical celebrity section senior’s “last hour” one fine morning in the year nassau w senior who may be called the belesprit of english economists well known alike for his economic “science” and for his beautiful style was summoned from oxford to manchester to learn in the latter place the political economy that he taught in the former the manufacturers elected him as their champion not only against the newly passed factory act but against the still more menacing tenhours’ agitation with their usual practical acuteness they had found out that the learned professor “wanted a good deal of finishing” it was this discovery that caused them to write for him on his side the professor has embodied the lecture he received from the manchester manufacturers in a pamphlet entitled “letters on the factory act as it affects the cotton manufacture” london here we find amongst others the following edifying passage “under the present law no mill in which persons under years of age are employed can be worked more than ½ hours a day that is hours for days in the week and nine on saturday “now the following analysis will show that in a mill so worked the whole net profit is derived from the last hour i will suppose a manufacturer to invest £ – £ in his mill and machinery and £ in raw material and wages the annual return of that mill supposing the capital to be turned once a year and gross profits to be per cent ought to be goods worth £ of this £ each of the twentythree halfhours of work produces ths or one twentythird of these rds constituting the whole £ twenty that is to say £ out of the £ simply replace the capital – one twentythird or £ out of the £ makes up for the deterioration of the mill and machinery the remaining rds that is the last two of the twentythree halfhours of every day produce the net profit of per cent if therefore prices remaining the same the factory could be kept at work thirteen hours instead of eleven and a half with an addition of about £ to the circulating capital the net profit would be more than doubled on the other hand if the hours of working were reduced by one hour per day prices remaining the same the net profit would be destroyed – if they were reduced by one hour and a half even the gross profit would be destroyed” and the professor calls this an “analysis” if giving credence to the outcries of the manufacturers he believed that the workmen spend the best part of the day in the production ie the reproduction or replacement of the value of the buildings machinery cotton coal c then his analysis was superfluous his answer would simply have been – gentlemen if you work your mills for hours instead of ½ then other things being equal the daily consumption of cotton machinery c will decrease in proportion you gain just as much as you lose your workpeople will in future spend one hour and a half less time in reproducing or replacing the capital that has been advanced – if on the other hand he did not believe them without further inquiry but as being an expert in such matters deemed an analysis necessary then he ought in a question that is concerned exclusively with the relations of net profit to the length of the working day before all things to have asked the manufacturers to be careful not to lump together machinery workshops raw material and labour but to be good enough to place the constant capital invested in buildings machinery raw material c on one side of the account and the capital advanced in wages on the other side if the professor then found that in accordance with the calculation of the manufacturers the workman reproduced or replaced his wages in halfhours in that case he should have continued his analysis thus according to your figures the workman in the last hour but one produces his wages and in the last hour your surplusvalue or net profit now since in equal periods he produces equal values the produce of the last hour but one must have the same value as that of the last hour further it is only while he labours that he produces any value at all and the amount of his labour is measured by his labourtime this you say amounts to ½ hours a day he employs one portion of these ½ hours in producing or replacing his wages and the remaining portion in producing your net profit beyond this he does absolutely nothing but since on your assumption his wages and the surplusvalue he yields are of equal value it is clear that he produces his wages in ¾ hours and your net profit in the other ¾ hours again since the value of the yarn produced in hours is equal to the sum of the values of his wages and of your net profit the measure of the value of this yarn must be ½ workinghours of which ¾ hours measure the value of the yarn produced in the last hour but one and ¾ the value of the yarn produced in the last hour we now come to a ticklish point therefore attention the last workinghour but one is like the first an ordinary workinghour neither more nor less how then can the spinner produce in one hour in the shape of yarn a value that embodies ¾ hours’ labour the truth is that he performs no such miracle the usevalue produced by him in one hour is a definite quantity of yarn the value of this yarn is measured by ¾ workinghours of which ¾ were without any assistance from him previously embodied in the means of production in the cotton the machinery and so on the remaining one hour alone is added by him therefore since his wages are produced in ¾ hours and the yarn produced in one hour also contains ¾ hours’ work there is no witchcraft in the result that the value created by his ¾ hours’ spinning is equal to the value of the product spun in one hour you are altogether on the wrong track if you think that he loses a single moment of his working day in reproducing or replacing the values of the cotton the machinery and so on on the contrary it is because his labour converts the cotton and spindles into yarn because he spins that the values of the cotton and spindles go over to the yarn of their own accord this result is owing to the quality of his labour not to its quantity it is true he will in one hour transfer to the yarn more value in the shape of cotton than he will in half an hour but that is only because in one hour he spins up more cotton than in half an hour you see then your assertion that the workman produces in the last hour but one the value of his wages and in the last hour your net profit amounts to no more than this that in the yarn produced by him in workinghours whether they are the first or the last hours of the working day in that yarn there are incorporated ½ workinghours or just a whole day’s work ie two hours of his own work and ½ hours of other people’s and my assertion that in the first ¾ hours he produces his wages and in the last ¾ hours your net profit amounts only to this that you pay him for the former but not for the latter in speaking of payment of labour instead of payment of labourpower i only talk your own slang now gentlemen if you compare the workingtime you pay for with that which you do not pay for you will find that they are to one another as half a day is to half a day this gives a rate of and a very pretty percentage it is further there is not the least doubt that if you make your “hands” toil for hours instead of ½ and as may be expected from you treat the work done in that extra one hour and a half as pure surplus labour then the latter will be increased from ¾ hours’ labour to ¼ hours’ labour and the rate of surplusvalue from to so that you are altogether too sanguine in expecting that by such an addition of ½ hours to the working day the rate will rise from to and more in other words that it will be “more than doubled” on the other hand ‒ man’s heart is a wonderful thing especially when carried in the purse – you take too pessimist a view when you fear that with a reduction of the hours of labour from ½ to the whole of your net profit will go to the dogs not at all all other conditions remaining the same the surplus labour will fall from ¾ hours to ¾ hours a period that still gives a very profitable rate of surplusvalue namely but this dreadful “last hour” about which you have invented more stories than have the millenarians about the day of judgment is “all bosh” if it goes it will cost neither you your net profit nor the boys and girls whom you employ their “purity of mind” whenever your “last hour” strikes in earnest think of the oxford professor and now gentlemen “farewell and may we meet again in yonder better world but not before” senior invented the battle cry of the “last hour” in in the london economist of the th april the same cry was again raised by james wilson an economic mandarin of high standing this time in opposition to the hours’ bill section surplusproduce the portion of the product that represents the surplusvalue one tenth of the lbs or lbs of yarn in the example given in sec we call “surplusproduce” just as the rate of surplusvalue is determined by its relation not to the sum total of the capital but to its variable part in like manner the relative quantity of surplusproduce is determined by the ratio that this produce bears not to the remaining part of the total product but to that part of it in which is incorporated the necessary labour since the production of surplusvalue is the chief end and aim of capitalist production it is clear that the greatness of a man’s or a nation’s wealth should be measured not by the absolute quantity produced but by the relative magnitude of the surplusproduce the sum of the necessary labour and the surplus labour ie of the periods of time during which the workman replaces the value of his labourpower and produces the surplusvalue this sum constitutes the actual time during which he works ie the working day chapter the working day section the limits of the working day we started with the supposition that labourpower is bought and sold at its value its value like that of all other commodities is determined by the workingtime necessary to its production if the production of the average daily means of subsistence of the labourer takes up hours he must work on the average hours every day to produce his daily labourpower or to reproduce the value received as the result of its sale the necessary part of his working day amounts to hours and is therefore caeteris paribus other things being equal a given quantity but with this the extent of the working day itself is not yet given let us assume that the line a–––b represents the length of the necessary workingtime say hours if the labour be prolonged or hours beyond a––b we have other lines working day i working day ii working day iii a–––b–c a–––b––c a–––b–––c representing different working days of and hours the extension b––c of the line a––b represents the length of the surplus labour as the working day is a––b b––c or a––c it varies with the variable quantity b––c since a––b is constant the ratio of b––c to a––b can always be calculated in working day i it is in working day ii in working day iii of a––b since further the ratio surplus workingtimenecessary workingtime determines the rate of the surplusvalue the latter is given by the ratio of b–c to a–b it amounts in the different working days respectively to and per cent on the other hand the rate of surplusvalue alone would not give us the extent of the working day if this rate eg were per cent the working day might be of or more hours it would indicate that the constituent parts of the working day necessarylabour and surplus labour time were equal in extent but not how long each of these two constituent parts was the working day is thus not a constant but a variable quantity one of its parts certainly is determined by the workingtime required for the reproduction of the labourpower of the labourer himself but its total amount varies with the duration of the surplus labour the working day is therefore determinable but is per se indeterminate although the working day is not a fixed but a fluent quantity it can on the other hand only vary within certain limits the minimum limit is however not determinable of course if we make the extension line b–c or the surplus labour we have a minimum limit ie the part of the day which the labourer must necessarily work for his own maintenance on the basis of capitalist production however this necessary labour can form a part only of the working day the working day itself can never be reduced to this minimum on the other hand the working day has a maximum limit it cannot be prolonged beyond a certain point this maximum limit is conditioned by two things first by the physical bounds of labourpower within the hours of the natural day a man can expend only a definite quantity of his vital force a horse in like manner can only work from day to day hours during part of the day this force must rest sleep during another part the man has to satisfy other physical needs to feed wash and clothe himself besides these purely physical limitations the extension of the working day encounters moral ones the labourer needs time for satisfying his intellectual and social wants the extent and number of which are conditioned by the general state of social advancement the variation of the working day fluctuates therefore within physical and social bounds but both these limiting conditions are of a very elastic nature and allow the greatest latitude so we find working days of hours ie of the most different lengths the capitalist has bought the labourpower at its dayrate to him its usevalue belongs during one working day he has thus acquired the right to make the labourer work for him during one day but what is a working day at all events less than a natural day by how much the capitalist has his own views of this ultima thule the outermost limit the necessary limit of the working day as capitalist he is only capital personified his soul is the soul of capital but capital has one single life impulse the tendency to create value and surplusvalue to make its constant factor the means of production absorb the greatest possible amount of surplus labour capital is dead labour that vampirelike only lives by sucking living labour and lives the more the more labour it sucks the time during which the labourer works is the time during which the capitalist consumes the labourpower he has purchased of him if the labourer consumes his disposable time for himself he robs the capitalist the capitalist then takes his stand on the law of the exchange of commodities he like all other buyers seeks to get the greatest possible benefit out of the usevalue of his commodity suddenly the voice of the labourer which had been stifled in the storm and stress of the process of production rises the commodity that i have sold to you differs from the crowd of other commodities in that its use creates value and a value greater than its own that is why you bought it that which on your side appears a spontaneous expansion of capital is on mine extra expenditure of labourpower you and i know on the market only one law that of the exchange of commodities and the consumption of the commodity belongs not to the seller who parts with it but to the buyer who acquires it to you therefore belongs the use of my daily labourpower but by means of the price that you pay for it each day i must be able to reproduce it daily and to sell it again apart from natural exhaustion through age c i must be able on the morrow to work with the same normal amount of force health and freshness as today you preach to me constantly the gospel of “saving” and “abstinence” good i will like a sensible saving owner husband my sole wealth labourpower and abstain from all foolish waste of it i will each day spend set in motion put into action only as much of it as is compatible with its normal duration and healthy development by an unlimited extension of the working day you may in one day use up a quantity of labourpower greater than i can restore in three what you gain in labour i lose in substance the use of my labourpower and the spoliation of it are quite different things if the average time that doing a reasonable amount of work an average labourer can live is years the value of my labourpower which you pay me from day to day is × or of its total value but if you consume it in years you pay me daily instead of of its total value ie only of its daily value and you rob me therefore every day of of the value of my commodity you pay me for one day’s labourpower whilst you use that of days that is against our contract and the law of exchanges i demand therefore a working day of normal length and i demand it without any appeal to your heart for in money matters sentiment is out of place you may be a model citizen perhaps a member of the society for the prevention of cruelty to animals and in the odour of sanctity to boot but the thing that you represent face to face with me has no heart in its breast that which seems to throb there is my own heartbeating i demand the normal working day because i like every other seller demand the value of my commodity we see then that apart from extremely elastic bounds the nature of the exchange of commodities itself imposes no limit to the working day no limit to surplus labour the capitalist maintains his rights as a purchaser when he tries to make the working day as long as possible and to make whenever possible two working days out of one on the other hand the peculiar nature of the commodity sold implies a limit to its consumption by the purchaser and the labourer maintains his right as seller when he wishes to reduce the working day to one of definite normal duration there is here therefore an antinomy right against right both equally bearing the seal of the law of exchanges between equal rights force decides hence is it that in the history of capitalist production the determination of what is a working day presents itself as the result of a struggle a struggle between collective capital ie the class of capitalists and collective labour ie the workingclass section the greed for surpluslabour manufacturer and boyard capital has not invented surplus labour wherever a part of society possesses the monopoly of the means of production the labourer free or not free must add to the workingtime necessary for his own maintenance an extra workingtime in order to produce the means of subsistence for the owners of the means of production whether this proprietor be the athenian χαλος γαχαθος welltodo man etruscan theocrat civis romanus roman citizen norman baron american slaveowner wallachian boyard modern landlord or capitalist it is however clear that in any given economic formation of society where not the exchangevalue but the usevalue of the product predominates surplus labour will be limited by a given set of wants which may be greater or less and that here no boundless thirst for surplus labour arises from the nature of the production itself hence in antiquity overwork becomes horrible only when the object is to obtain exchangevalue in its specific independent moneyform in the production of gold and silver compulsory working to death is here the recognised form of overwork only read diodorus siculus still these are exceptions in antiquity but as soon as people whose production still moves within the lower forms of slavelabour corvéelabour c are drawn into the whirlpool of an international market dominated by the capitalistic mode of production the sale of their products for export becoming their principal interest the civilised horrors of overwork are grafted on the barbaric horrors of slavery serfdom c hence the negro labour in the southern states of the american union preserved something of a patriarchal character so long as production was chiefly directed to immediate local consumption but in proportion as the export of cotton became of vital interest to these states the overworking of the negro and sometimes the using up of his life in years of labour became a factor in a calculated and calculating system it was no longer a question of obtaining from him a certain quantity of useful products it was now a question of production of surplus labour itself so was it also with the corvée eg in the danubian principalities now roumania the comparison of the greed for surplus labour in the danubian principalities with the same greed in english factories has a special interest because surplus labour in the corvée has an independent and palpable form suppose the working day consists of hours of necessary labour and hours of surplus labour then the free labourer gives the capitalist every week x or hours of surplus labour it is the same as if he worked days in the week for himself and days in the week gratis for the capitalist but this is not evident on the surface surplus labour and necessary labour glide one into the other i can therefore express the same relationship by saying eg that the labourer in every minute works seconds for himself and for the capitalist etc it is otherwise with the corvée the necessary labour which the wallachian peasant does for his own maintenance is distinctly marked off from his surplus labour on behalf of the boyard the one he does on his own field the other on the seignorial estate both parts of the labourtime exist therefore independently side by side one with the other in the corvée the surplus labour is accurately marked off from the necessary labour this however can make no difference with regard to the quantitative relation of surplus labour to necessary labour three days’ surplus labour in the week remain three days that yield no equivalent to the labourer himself whether it be called corvée or wagelabour but in the capitalist the greed for surplus labour appears in the straining after an unlimited extension of the working day in the boyard more simply in a direct hunting after days of corvée in the danubian principalities the corvée was mixed up with rents in kind and other appurtenances of bondage but it formed the most important tribute paid to the ruling class where this was the case the corvée rarely arose from serfdom serfdom much more frequently on the other hand took origin from the corvée this is what took place in the roumanian provinces their original mode of production was based on community of the soil but not in the slavonic or indian form part of the land was cultivated in severalty as freehold by the members of the community another part – ager publicus – was cultivated by them in common the products of this common labour served partly as a reserve fund against bad harvests and other accidents partly as a public store for providing the costs of war religion and other common expenses in course of time military and clerical dignitaries usurped along with the common land the labour spent upon it the labour of the free peasants on their common land was transformed into corvée for the thieves of the common land this corvée soon developed into a servile relationship existing in point of fact not in point of law until russia the liberator of the world made it legal under presence of abolishing serfdom the code of the corvée which the russian general kisseleff proclaimed in was of course dictated by the boyards themselves thus russia conquered with one blow the magnates of the danubian provinces and the applause of liberal cretins throughout europe according to the “règlement organique” as this code of the corvée is called every wallachian peasant owes to the socalled landlord besides a mass of detailed payments in kind days of general labour one day of field labour one day of wood carrying in all days in the year with deep insight into political economy however the working day is not taken in its ordinary sense but as the working day necessary to the production of an average daily product and that average daily product is determined in so crafty a way that no cyclops would be done with it in hours in dry words the réglement itself declares with true russian irony that by working days one must understand the product of the manual labour of days by day of field labour days and by day of wood carrying in like manner three times as much in all corvée days to this had to be added the socalled jobagie service due to the lord for extraordinary occasions in proportion to the size of its population every village has to furnish annually a definite contingent to the jobagie this additional corvée is estimated at days for each wallachian peasant thus the prescribed corvée amounts to working days yearly but the agricultural year in wallachia numbers in consequence of the severe climate only days of which for sundays and holidays on an average for bad weather together days do not count working days remain the ratio of the corvée to the necessary labour or gives a much smaller rate of surplusvalue than that which regulates the labour of the english agricultural or factory labourer this is however only the legally prescribed corvée and in a spirit yet more “liberal” than the english factory acts the “règlement organique” has known how to facilitate its own evasion after it has made days out of the nominal day’s work of each of the corvée days is again so arranged that a portion of it must fall on the ensuing day in one day eg must be weeded an extent of land which for this work especially in maize plantations needs twice as much time the legal day’s work for some kinds of agricultural labour is interpretable in such a way that the day begins in may and ends in october in moldavia conditions are still harder “the corvée days of the ‘règlement organique’ cried a boyard drunk with victory amount to days in the year” if the règlement organique of the danubian provinces was a positive expression of the greed for surplus labour which every paragraph legalised the english factory acts are the negative expression of the same greed these acts curb the passion of capital for a limitless draining of labourpower by forcibly limiting the working day by state regulations made by a state that is ruled by capitalistand landlord apart from the workingclass movement that daily grew more threatening the limiting of factory labour was dictated by the same necessity which spread guano over the english fields the same blind eagerness for plunder that in the one case exhausted the soil had in the other torn up by the roots the living force of the nation periodical epidemics speak on this point as clearly as the diminishing military standard in germany and france the factory act of now in force allows for the average working day hours ie for the first days hours from am to pm including ½ an hour for breakfast and an hour for dinner and thus leaving ½ workinghours and hours for saturday from am to pm of which ½ an hour is subtracted for breakfast workinghours are left ½ for each of the first days ½ for the last certain guardians of these laws are appointed factory inspectors directly under the home secretary whose reports are published halfyearly by order of parliament they give regular and official statistics of the capitalistic greed for surplus labour let us listen for a moment to the factory inspectors “the fraudulent millowner begins work a quarter of an hour sometimes more sometimes less before am and leaves off a quarter of an hour sometimes more sometimes less after pm he takes minutes from the beginning and from the end of the half hour nominally allowed for breakfast and minutes at the beginning and end of the hour nominally allowed for dinner he works for a quarter of an hour sometimes more sometimes less after pm on saturday thus his gain is – before am minutes after pm at breakfast time at dinner time five days – minutes on saturday before am minutes at breakfast time after pm minutes total weekly minutes or hours and minutes weekly which multiplied by working weeks in the year allowing two for holidays and occasional stoppages is equal to working days” “five minutes a day’s increased work multiplied by weeks are equal to two and a half days of produce in the year” “an additional hour a day gained by small instalments before am after pm and at the beginning and end of the times nominally fixed for meals is nearly equivalent to working months in the year” crises during which production is interrupted and the factories work “short time” ie for only a part of the week naturally do not affect the tendency to extend the working day the less business there is the more profit has to be made on the business done the less time spent in work the more of that time has to be turned into surplus labourtime thus the factory inspector’s report on the period of the crisis from to “it may seem inconsistent that there should be any overworking at a time when trade is so bad but that very badness leads to the transgression by unscrupulous men they get the extra profit of it in the last half year says leonard horner mills in my district have been given up were found standing” yet overwork is continued beyond the legal hours” “for a great part of the time” says mr howell “owing to the depression of trade many factories were altogether closed and a still greater number were working short time i continue however to receive about the usual number of complaints that half or threequarters of an hour in the day are snatched from the workers by encroaching upon the times professedly allowed for rest and refreshment” the same phenomenon was reproduced on a smaller scale during the frightful cottoncrises from to “it is sometimes advanced by way of excuse when persons are found at work in a factory either at a meal hour or at some illegal time that they will not leave the mill at the appointed hour and that compulsion is necessary to force them to cease work cleaning their machinery c especially on saturday afternoons but if the hands remain in a factory after the machinery has ceased to revolve they would not have been so employed if sufficient time had been set apart specially for cleaning c either before am sic or before pm on saturday afternoons” “the profit to be gained by it overworking in violation of the act appears to be to many a greater temptation than they can resist they calculate upon the chance of not being found out and when they see the small amount of penalty and costs which those who have been convicted have had to pay they find that if they should be detected there will still be a considerable balance of gain in cases where the additional time is gained by a multiplication of small thefts in the course of the day there are insuperable difficulties to the inspectors making out a case” these “small thefts” of capital from the labourer’s meal and recreation time the factory inspectors also designate as “petty pilferings of minutes” “snatching a few minutes” or as the labourers technically called them “nibbling and cribbling at mealtimes” it is evident that in this atmosphere the formation of surplusvalue by surplus labour is no secret “if you allow me” said a highly respectable master to me “to work only ten minutes in the day overtime you put one thousand a year in my pocket” “moments are the elements of profit” nothing is from this point of view more characteristic than the designation of the workers who work full time as “fulltimers” and the children under who are only allowed to work hours as “halftimers” the worker is here nothing more than personified labourtime all individual distinctions are merged in those of “fulltimers” and “halftimers” section branches of english industry without legal limits to exploitation we have hitherto considered the tendency to the extension of the working day the werewolf’s hunger for surplus labour in a department where the monstrous exactions not surpassed says an english bourgeois economist by the cruelties of the spaniards to the american redskins caused capital at last to be bound by the chains of legal regulations now let us cast a glance at certain branches of production in which the exploitation of labour is either free from fetters to this day or was so yesterday mr broughton charlton county magistrate declared as chairman of a meeting held at the assembly rooms nottingham on the th january “that there was an amount of privation and suffering among that portion of the population connected with the lace trade unknown in other parts of the kingdom indeed in the civilised world children of nine or ten years are dragged from their squalid beds at two three or four o’clock in the morning and compelled to work for a bare subsistence until ten eleven or twelve at night their limbs wearing away their frames dwindling their faces whitening and their humanity absolutely sinking into a stonelike torpor utterly horrible to contemplate we are not surprised that mr mallett or any other manufacturer should stand forward and protest against discussion the system as the rev montagu valpy describes it is one of unmitigated slavery socially physically morally and spiritually what can be thought of a town which holds a public meeting to petition that the period of labour for men shall be diminished to eighteen hours a day we declaim against the virginian and carolinian cottonplanters is their blackmarket their lash and their barter of human flesh more detestable than this slow sacrifice of humanity which takes place in order that veils and collars may be fabricated for the benefit of capitalists” the potteries of staffordshire have during the last years been the subject of three parliamentary inquiries the result is embodied in mr scriven’s report of to the “children’s employment commissioners” in the report of dr greenhow of published by order of the medical officer of the privy council public health rd report lastly in the report of mr longe of in the “first report of the children’s employment commission of the th june ” for my purpose it is enough to take from the reports of and some depositions of the exploited children themselves from the children we may form an opinion as to the adults especially the girls and women and that in a branch of industry by the side of which cottonspinning appears an agreeable and healthful occupation william wood years old was years and months when he began to work he “ran moulds” carried readymoulded articles into the dryingroom afterwards bringing back the empty mould from the beginning he came to work every day in the week at am and left off about pm “i work till o’clock at night six days in the week i have done so seven or eight weeks” fifteen hours of labour for a child years old j murray years of age says “i turn jigger and run moulds i come at sometimes i come at i worked all night last night till o’clock this morning i have not been in bed since the night before last there were eight or nine other boys working last night all but one have come this morning i get shillings and sixpence i do not get any more for working at night i worked two nights last week” fernyhough a boy of ten “i have not always an hour for dinner i have only half an hour sometimes on thursday friday and saturday” dr greenhow states that the average duration of life in the pottery districts of stokeontrent and wolstanton is extraordinarily short although in the district of stoke only and in wolstanton only of the adult male population above are employed in the potteries among the men of that age in the first district more than half in the second nearly of the whole deaths are the result of pulmonary diseases among the potters dr boothroyd a medical practitioner at hanley says “each successive generation of potters is more dwarfed and less robust than the preceding one” in like manner another doctor mr m’bean “since he began to practice among the potters years ago he had observed a marked degeneration especially shown in diminution of stature and breadth” these statements are taken from the report of dr greenhow in from the report of the commissioners in the following dr j t arledge senior physician of the north staffordshire infirmary says “the potters as a class both men and women represent a degenerated population both physically and morally they are as a rule stunted in growth illshaped and frequently illformed in the chest they become prematurely old and are certainly shortlived they are phlegmatic and bloodless and exhibit their debility of constitution by obstinate attacks of dyspepsia and disorders of the liver and kidneys and by rheumatism but of all diseases they are especially prone to chestdisease to pneumonia phthisis bronchitis and asthma one form would appear peculiar to them and is known as potter’s asthma or potter’s consumption scrofula attacking the glands or bones or other parts of the body is a disease of twothirds or more of the potters that the ‘degenerescence’ of the population of this district is not even greater than it is is due to the constant recruiting from the adjacent country and intermarriages with more healthy races” mr charles parsons late house surgeon of the same institution writes in a letter to commissioner longe amongst other things “i can only speak from personal observation and not from statistical data but i do not hesitate to assert that my indignation has been aroused again and again at the sight of poor children whose health has been sacrificed to gratify the avarice of either parents or employers” he enumerates the causes of the diseases of the potters and sums them up in the phrase “long hours” the report of the commission trusts that “a manufacture which has assumed so prominent a place in the whole world will not long be subject to the remark that its great success is accompanied with the physical deterioration widespread bodily suffering and early death of the workpeople by whose labour and skill such great results have been achieved” and all that holds of the potteries in england is true of those in scotland the manufacture of lucifer matches dates from from the discovery of the method of applying phosphorus to the match itself since this manufacture has rapidly developed in england and has extended especially amongst the thickly populated parts of london as well as in manchester birmingham liverpool bristol norwich newcastle and glasgow with it has spread the form of lockjaw which a vienna physician in discovered to be a disease peculiar to lucifermatchmakers half the workers are children under thirteen and young persons under eighteen the manufacture is on account of its unhealthiness and unpleasantness in such bad odour that only the most miserable part of the labouring class halfstarved widows and so forth deliver up their children to it “the ragged halfstarved untaught children” of the witnesses that commissioner white examined were under under only and only years old a range of the working day from to or hours nightlabour irregular mealtimes meals for the most part taken in the very workrooms that are pestilent with phosphorus dante would have found the worst horrors of his inferno surpassed in this manufacture in the manufacture of paperhangings the coarser sorts are printed by machine the finer by hand blockprinting the most active business months are from the beginning of october to the end of april during this time the work goes on fast and furious without intermission from am to pm or further into the night j leach deposes “last winter six out of nineteen girls were away from illhealth at one time from overwork i have to bawl at them to keep them awake” w duffy “i have seen when the children could none of them keep their eyes open for the work indeed none of us could” j lightbourne “am we worked last winter till evening and the winter before till i used to cry with sore feet every night last winter” g apsden “that boy of mine when he was years old i used to carry him on my back to and fro through the snow and he used to have hours a day i have often knelt down to feed him as he stood by the machine for he could not leave it or stop” smith the managing partner of a manchester factory “we he means his “hands” who work for “us” work on with no stoppage for meals so that day’s work of ½ hours is finished by pm and all after that is overtime” does this mr smith take no meals himself during ½ hours “we this same smith seldom leave off working before pm he means leave off the consumption of “our” labourpower machines so that we iterum crispinus are really working overtime the whole year round for all these children and adults alike children and young persons and adults the average work for the last months has been at the very least days hours or hours a week for the six weeks ending may nd this year the average was higher – days or hours a week” still this same mr smith who is so extremely devoted to the pluralis majestatis the royal “we” ie speaking on behalf of his subjects adds with a smile machinework is not great” so the employers in the blockprinting say “hand labour is more healthy than machine work” on the whole manufacturers declare with indignation against the proposal “to stop the machines at least during mealtimes” “a clause” says mr otley manager of a wallpaper factory in the borough “which allowed work between say am and pm in would suit us very well but the factory hours am to pm are not suitable our machine is always stopped for dinner what generosity there is no waste of paper and colour to speak of but” he adds sympathetically “i can understand the loss of time not being liked” the report of the commission opines with naïveté that the fear of some “leading firms” of losing time ie the time for appropriating the labour of others and thence losing profit is not a sufficient reason for allowing children under and young persons under working to hours per day to lose their dinner nor for giving it to them as coal and water are supplied to the steamengine soap to wool oil to the wheel – as merely auxiliary material to the instruments of labour during the process of production itself no branch of industry in england we do not take into account the making of bread by machinery recently introduced has preserved up to the present day a method of production so archaic so – as we see from the poets of the roman empire – prechristian as baking but capital as was said earlier is at first indifferent as to the technical character of the labourprocess it begins by taking it just as it finds it the incredible adulteration of bread especially in london was first revealed by the house of commons committee “on the adulteration of articles of food” and dr hassall’s work “adulterations detected” the consequence of these revelations was the act of august th “for preventing the adulteration of articles of food and drink” an inoperative law as it naturally shows the tenderest consideration for every freetrader who determines by the buying or selling of adulterated commodities “to turn an honest penny” the committee itself formulated more or less naïvely its conviction that freetrade meant essentially trade with adulterated or as the english ingeniously put it “sophisticated” goods in fact this kind of sophistry knows better than protagoras how to make white black and black white and better than the eleatics how to demonstrate ad oculos before your own eyes that everything is only appearance at all events the committee had directed the attention of the public to its “daily bread” and therefore to the baking trade at the same time in public meetings and in petitions to parliament rose the cry of the london journeymen bakers against their overwork c the cry was so urgent that mr h s tremenheere also a member of the commission of several times mentioned was appointed royal commissioner of inquiry his report together with the evidence given roused not the heart of the public but its stomach englishmen always well up in the bible knew well enough that man unless by elective grace a capitalist or landlord or sinecurist is commanded to eat his bread in the sweat of his brow but they did not know that he had to eat daily in his bread a certain quantity of human perspiration mixed with the discharge of abscesses cobwebs dead blackbeetles and putrid german yeast without counting alum sand and other agreeable mineral ingredients without any regard to his holiness freetrade the free bakingtrade was therefore placed under the supervision of the state inspectors close of the parliamentary session of and by the same act of parliament work from in the evening to in the morning was forbidden for journeymen bakers under the last clause speaks volumes as to the overwork in this oldfashioned homely line of business “the work of a london journeyman baker begins as a rule at about eleven at night at that hour he ‘makes the dough’ – a laborious process which lasts from half an hour to three quarters of an hour according to the size of the batch or the labour bestowed upon it he then lies down upon the kneadingboard which is also the covering of the trough in which the dough is ‘made’ and with a sack under him and another rolled up as a pillow he sleeps for about a couple of hours he is then engaged in a rapid and continuous labour for about five hours – throwing out the dough ‘scaling it off’ moulding it putting it into the oven preparing and baking rolls and fancy bread taking the batch bread out of the oven and up into the shop c c the temperature of a bakehouse ranges from about to upwards of degrees and in the smaller bakehouses approximates usually to the higher rather than to the lower degree of heat when the business of making the bread rolls c is over that of its distribution begins and a considerable proportion of the journeymen in the trade after working hard in the manner described during the night are upon their legs for many hours during the day carrying baskets or wheeling handcarts and sometimes again in the bakehouse leaving off work at various hours between and pm according to the season of the year or the amount and nature of their master’s business while others are again engaged in the bakehouse in ‘bringing out’ more batches until late in the afternoon during what is called ‘the london season’ the operatives belonging to the ‘fullpriced’ bakers at the west end of the town generally begin work at pm and are engaged in making the bread with one or two short sometimes very short intervals of rest up to o’clock the next morning they are then engaged all day long up to and as late as o’clock in the evening carrying out bread or sometimes in the afternoon in the bakehouse again assisting in the biscuitbaking they may have after they have done their work sometimes five or six sometimes only four or five hours’ sleep before they begin again on fridays they always begin sooner some about ten o’clock and continue in some cases at work either in making or delivering the bread up to pm on saturday night but more generally up to or o’clock sunday morning on sundays the men must attend twice or three times during the day for an hour or two to make preparations for the next day’s bread the men employed by the underselling masters who sell their bread under the ‘full price’ and who as already pointed out comprise threefourths of the london bakers have not only to work on the average longer hours but their work is almost entirely confined to the bakehouse the underselling masters generally sell their bread in the shop if they send it out which is not common except as supplying chandlers’ shops they usually employ other hands for that purpose it is not their practice to deliver bread from house to house towards the end of the week the men begin on thursday night at o’clock and continue on with only slight intermission until late on saturday evening” even the bourgeois intellect understands the position of the “underselling” masters “the unpaid labour of the men was made the source whereby the competition was carried on” and the “fullpriced” baker denounces his underselling competitors to the commission of inquiry as thieves of foreign labour and adulterators “they only exist now by first defrauding the public and next getting hours’ work out of their men for hours’ wages” the adulteration of bread and the formation of a class of bakers that sells the bread below the full price date from the beginning of the th century from the time when the corporate character of the trade was lost and the capitalist in the form of the miller or flourfactor rises behind the nominal master baker thus was laid the foundation of capitalistic production in this trade of the unlimited extension of the working day and of nightlabour although the latter only since gained a serious footing even in london after what has just been said it will be understood that the report of the commission classes journeymen bakers among the shortlived labourers who having by good luck escaped the normal decimation of the children of the workingclass rarely reach the age of nevertheless the baking trade is always overwhelmed with applicants the sources of the supply of these labourpowers to london are scotland the western agricultural districts of england and germany in the years the journeymen bakers in ireland organised at their own expense great meetings to agitate against night and sunday work the public – eg at the dublin meeting in may – took their part with irish warmth as a result of this movement daylabour alone was successfully established in wexford kilkenny clonmel waterford c “in limerick where the grievances of the journeymen are demonstrated to be excessive the movement has been defeated by the opposition of the master bakers the miller bakers being the greatest opponents the example of limerick led to a retrogression in ennis and tipperary in cork where the strongest possible demonstration of feeling took place the masters by exercising their power of turning the men out of employment have defeated the movement in dublin the master bakers have offered the most determined opposition to the movement and by discountenancing as much as possible the journeymen promoting it have succeeded in leading the men into acquiescence in sunday work and nightwork contrary to the convictions of the men” the committee of the english government which government in ireland is armed to the teeth and generally knows how to show it remonstrates in mild though funereal tones with the implacable master bakers of dublin limerick cork c “the committee believe that the hours of labour are limited by natural laws which cannot be violated with impunity that for master bakers to induce their workmen by the fear of losing employment to violate their religious convictions and their better feelings to disobey the laws of the land and to disregard public opinion this all refers to sunday labour is calculated to provoke illfeeling between workmen and masters and affords an example dangerous to religion morality and social order the committee believe that any constant work beyond hours aday encroaches on the domestic and private life of the workingman and so leads to disastrous moral results interfering with each man’s home and the discharge of his family duties as a son a brother a husband a father that work beyond hours has a tendency to undermine the health of the workingman and so leads to premature old age and death to the great injury of families of workingmen thus deprived of the care and support of the head of the family when most required” so far we have dealt with ireland on the other side of the channel in scotland the agricultural labourer the ploughman protests against his hours’ work in the most inclement climate with hours’ additional work on sunday in this land of sabbatarians whilst at the same time three railway men are standing before a london coroner’s jury – a guard an enginedriver a signalman a tremendous railway accident has hurried hundreds of passengers into another world the negligence of the employee is the cause of the misfortune they declare with one voice before the jury that ten or twelve years before their labour only lasted eight hours aday during the last five or six years it had been screwed up to and hours and under a specially severe pressure of holidaymakers at times of excursion trains it often lasted for or hours without a break they were ordinary men not cyclops at a certain point their labourpower failed torpor seized them their brain ceased to think their eyes to see the thoroughly “respectable” british jurymen answered by a verdict that sent them to the next assizes on a charge of manslaughter and in a gentle “rider” to their verdict expressed the pious hope that the capitalistic magnates of the railways would in future be more extravagant in the purchase of a sufficient quantity of labourpower and more “abstemious” more “selfdenying” more “thrifty” in the draining of paid labourpower from the motley crowd of labourers of all callings ages sexes that press on us more busily than the souls of the slain on ulysses on whom – without referring to the blue books under their arms – we see at a glance the mark of overwork let us take two more figures whose striking contrast proves that before capital all men are alike – a milliner and a blacksmith in the last week of june all the london daily papers published a paragraph with the “sensational” heading “death from simple overwork” it dealt with the death of the milliner mary anne walkley years of age employed in a highlyrespectable dressmaking establishment exploited by a lady with the pleasant name of elise the old oftentold story was once more recounted this girl worked on an average ½ hours during the season often hours without a break whilst her failing labourpower was revived by occasional supplies of sherry port or coffee it was just now the height of the season it was necessary to conjure up in the twinkling of an eye the gorgeous dresses for the noble ladies bidden to the ball in honour of the newlyimported princess of wales mary anne walkley had worked without intermission for ½ hours with other girls in one room that only afforded of the cubic feet of air required for them at night they slept in pairs in one of the stifling holes into which the bedroom was divided by partitions of board and this was one of the best millinery establishments in london mary anne walkley fell ill on the friday died on sunday without to the astonishment of madame elise having previously completed the work in hand the doctor mr keys called too late to the deathbed duly bore witness before the coroner’s jury that “mary anne walkley had died from long hours of work in an overcrowded workroom and a too small and badly ventilated bedroom” in order to give the doctor a lesson in good manners the coroner’s jury thereupon brought in a verdict that “the deceased had died of apoplexy but there was reason to fear that her death had been accelerated by overwork in an overcrowded workroom c” “our white slaves” cried the morning star the organ of the freetraders cobden and bright “our white slaves who are toiled into the grave for the most part silently pine and die” “it is not in dressmakers’ rooms that working to death is the order of the day but in a thousand other places in every place i had almost said where ‘a thriving business’ has to be done we will take the blacksmith as a type if the poets were true there is no man so hearty so merry as the blacksmith he rises early and strikes his sparks before the sun he eats and drinks and sleeps as no other man working in moderation he is in fact in one of the best of human positions physically speaking but we follow him into the city or town and we see the stress of work on that strong man and what then is his position in the deathrate of his country in marylebone blacksmiths die at the rate of per thousand per annum or above the mean of the male adults of the country in its entirety the occupation instinctive almost as a portion of human art unobjectionable as a branch of human industry is made by mere excess of work the destroyer of the man he can strike so many blows per day walk so many steps breathe so many breaths produce so much work and live an average say of fifty years he is made to strike so many more blows to walk so many more steps to breathe so many more breaths per day and to increase altogether a fourth of his life he meets the effort the result is that producing for a limited time a fourth more work he dies at for ” section day and night work the relay system constant capital the means of production considered from the standpoint of the creation of surplusvalue only exist to absorb labour and with every drop of labour a proportional quantity of surplus labour while they fail to do this their mere existence causes a relative loss to the capitalist for they represent during the time they lie fallow a useless advance of capital and this loss becomes positive and absolute as soon as the intermission of their employment necessitates additional outlay at the recommencement of work the prolongation of the working day beyond the limits of the natural day into the night only acts as a palliative it quenches only in a slight degree the vampire thirst for the living blood of labour to appropriate labour during all the hours of the day is therefore the inherent tendency of capitalist production but as it is physically impossible to exploit the same individual labourpower constantly during the night as well as the day to overcome this physical hindrance an alternation becomes necessary between the workpeople whose powers are exhausted by day and those who are used up by night this alternation may be effected in various ways eg it may be so arranged that part of the workers are one week employed on daywork the next week on nightwork it is well known that this relay system this alternation of two sets of workers held full sway in the fullblooded youthtime of the english cotton manufacture and that at the present time it still flourishes among others in the cotton spinning of the moscow district this hours’ process of production exists today as a system in many of the branches of industry of great britain that are still “free” in the blastfurnaces forges platerolling mills and other metallurgical establishments in england wales and scotland the workingtime here includes besides the hours of the working days a great part also of the hours of sunday the workers consist of men and women adults and children of both sexes the ages of the children and young persons run through all intermediate grades from in some cases from to in some branches of industry the girls and women work through the night together with the males placing on one side the generally injurious influence of nightlabour the duration of the process of production unbroken during the hours offers very welcome opportunities of exceeding the limits of the normal working day eg in the branches of industry already mentioned which are of an exceedingly fatiguing nature the official working day means for each worker usually hours by night or day but the overwork beyond this amount is in many cases to use the words of the english official report “truly fearful” “it is impossible” the report continues “for any mind to realise the amount of work described in the following passages as being performed by boys of from to years of age without coming irresistibly to the conclusion that such abuses of the power of parents and of employers can no longer be allowed to exist” the practice of boys working at all by day and night turns either in the usual course of things or at pressing times seems inevitably to open the door to their not unfrequently working unduly long hours these hours are indeed in some cases not only cruelly but even incredibly long for children amongst a number of boys it will of course not unfrequently happen that one or more are from some cause absent when this happens their place is made up by one or more boys who work in the other turn that this is a well understood system is plain from the answer of the manager of some large rollingmills who when i asked him how the place of the boys absent from their turn was made up ‘i daresay sir you know that as well as i do’ and admitted the fact” “at a rollingmill where the proper hours were from am to ½ pm a boy worked about four nights every week till ½ pm at least and this for six months another at years old sometimes made three hour shifts running and when has made two days and two nights running” a third “now worked from am till pm three nights and till pm the other nights” “another now worked from pm till noon next day for a week together and sometimes for three shifts together eg from monday morning till tuesday night” “another now has worked in an iron foundry at stavely from am till pm for a fortnight on end could not do it any more” “george allinsworth age came here as cellarboy last friday next morning we had to begin at so i stopped here all night live five miles off slept on the floor of the furnace over head with an apron under me and a bit of a jacket over me the two other days i have been here at am aye it is hot in here before i came here i was nearly a year at the same work at some works in the country began there too at on saturday morning – always did but was very gain near home and could sleep at home other days i began at in the morning and gi’en over at or in the evening” c let us now hear how capital itself regards this hours’ system the extreme forms of the system its abuse in the “cruel and incredible” extension of the working day are naturally passed over in silence capital only speaks of the system in its “normal” form messrs naylor vickers steel manufacturers who employ between and persons among whom only per cent are under and of those only boys under work in night sets thus express themselves “the boys do not suffer from the heat the temperature is probably from ° to ° at the forges and in the rolling mills the hands work night and day in relays but all the other parts of the work are daywork ie from am to pm in the forge the hours are from to some of the hands always work in the night without any alternation of day and night work we do not find any difference in the health of those who work regularly by night and those who work by day and probably people can sleep better if they have the same period of rest than if it is changed about of the boys under the age of work in the night sets we could not well do without lads under working by night the objection would be the increase in the cost of production skilled hands and the heads in every department are difficult to get but of lads we could get any number but from the small proportion of boys that we employ the subject ie of restrictions on nightwork is of little importance or interest to us” mr j ellis one of the firm of messrs john brown co steel and iron works employing about men and boys part of whose operations namely iron and heavier steel work goes on night and day by relays states “that in the heavier steel work one or two boys are employed to a score or two men” their concern employs upwards of boys under of whom about or are under the age of with reference to the proposed alteration of the law mr ellis says “i do not think it would be very objectionable to require that no person under the age of should work more than hours in the but we do not think that any line could be drawn over the age of at which boys could be dispensed with for nightwork but we would sooner be prevented from employing boys under the age of or even so high as at all than not be allowed to employ boys that we do have at night those boys who work in the day sets must take their turn in the night sets also because the men could not work in the night sets only it would ruin their health we think however that nightwork in alternate weeks is no harm” messrs naylor vickers on the other hand in conformity with the interest of their business considered that periodically changed nightlabour might possibly do more harm than continual nightlabour “we find the men who do it as well as the others who do other work only by day our objections to not allowing boys under to work at night would be on account of the increase of expense but this is the only reason” what cynical naïveté “we think that the increase would be more than the trade with due regard to its being successfully carried out could fairly bear what mealymouthed phraseology labour is scarce here and might fall short if there were such a regulation” ie ellis brown co might fall into the fatal perplexity of being obliged to pay labourpower its full value the “cyclops steel and iron works” of messrs cammell co are concocted on the same large scale as those of the abovementioned john brown co the managing director had handed in his evidence to the government commissioner mr white in writing later he found it convenient to suppress the ms when it had been returned to him for revision mr white however has a good memory he remembered quite clearly that for the messrs cyclops the forbidding of the nightlabour of children and young persons “would be impossible it would be tantamount to stopping their works” and yet their business employs little more than of boys under and less than under on the same subject mr e f sanderson of the firm of sanderson bros co steel rollingmills and forges attercliffe says “great difficulty would be caused by preventing boys under from working at night the chief would be the increase of cost from employing men instead of boys i cannot say what this would be but probably it would not be enough to enable the manufacturers to raise the price of steel and consequently it would fall on them as of course the men what queerheaded folk would refuse to pay it” mr sanderson does not know how much he pays the children but “perhaps the younger boys get from s to s a week the boys’ work is of a kind for which the strength of the boys is generally ‘generally’ of course not always quite sufficient and consequently there would be no gain in the greater strength of the men to counterbalance the loss or it would be only in the few cases in which the metal is heavy the men would not like so well not to have boys under them as men would be less obedient besides boys must begin young to learn the trade leaving daywork alone open to boys would not answer this purpose” and why not why could not boys learn their handicraft in the daytime your reason “owing to the men working days and nights in alternate weeks the men would be separated half the time from their boys and would lose half the profit which they make from them the training which they give to an apprentice is considered as part of the return for the boys’ labour and thus enables the man to get it at a cheaper rate each man would want half of this profit” in other words messrs sanderson would have to pay part of the wages of the adult men out of their own pockets instead of by the nightwork of the boys messrs sanderson’s profit would thus fall to some extent and this is the good sandersonian reason why boys cannot learn their handicraft in the day in addition to this it would throw nightlabour on those who worked instead of the boys which they would not be able to stand the difficulties in fact would be so great that they would very likely lead to the giving up of nightwork altogether and “as far as the work itself is concerned” says e f sanderson “this would suit as well but –” but messrs sanderson have something else to make besides steel steelmaking is simply a pretext for surplusvalue making the smelting furnaces rollingmills c the buildings machinery iron coal c have something more to do than transform themselves into steel they are there to absorb surplus labour and naturally absorb more in hours than in in fact they give by grace of god and law the sandersons a cheque on the workingtime of a certain number of hands for all the hours of the day and they lose their character as capital are therefore a pure loss for the sandersons as soon as their function of absorbing labour is interrupted “but then there would be the loss from so much expensive machinery lying idle half the time and to get through the amount of work which we are able to do on the present system we should have to double our premises and plant which would double the outlay” but why should these sandersons pretend to a privilege not enjoyed by the other capitalists who only work during the day and whose buildings machinery raw material therefore lie “idle” during the night e f sanderson answers in the name of all the sandersons “it is true that there is this loss from machinery lying idle in those manufactories in which work only goes on by day but the use of furnaces would involve a further loss in our case if they were kept up there would be a waste of fuel instead of as now a waste of the living substance of the workers and if they were not there would be loss of time in laying the fires and getting the heat up whilst the loss of sleeping time even to children of is a gain of workingtime for the sanderson tribe and the furnaces themselves would suffer from the changes of temperature” whilst those same furnaces suffer nothing from the day and night change of labour section the struggle for a normal working day compulsory laws for the extension of the working day from the middle of the th to the end of the th century “what is a working day what is the length of time during which capital may consume the labourpower whose daily value it buys how far may the working day be extended beyond the workingtime necessary for the reproduction of labourpower itself” it has been seen that to these questions capital replies the working day contains the full hours with the deduction of the few hours of repose without which labourpower absolutely refuses its services again hence it is selfevident that the labourer is nothing else his whole life through than labourpower that therefore all his disposable time is by nature and law labourtime to be devoted to the selfexpansion of capital time for education for intellectual development for the fulfilling of social functions and for social intercourse for the freeplay of his bodily and mental activity even the rest time of sunday and that in a country of sabbatarians – moonshine but in its blind unrestrainable passion its werewolf hunger for surplus labour capital oversteps not only the moral but even the merely physical maximum bounds of the working day it usurps the time for growth development and healthy maintenance of the body it steals the time required for the consumption of fresh air and sunlight it higgles over a mealtime incorporating it where possible with the process of production itself so that food is given to the labourer as to a mere means of production as coal is supplied to the boiler grease and oil to the machinery it reduces the sound sleep needed for the restoration reparation refreshment of the bodily powers to just so many hours of torpor as the revival of an organism absolutely exhausted renders essential it is not the normal maintenance of the labourpower which is to determine the limits of the working day it is the greatest possible daily expenditure of labourpower no matter how diseased compulsory and painful it may be which is to determine the limits of the labourers’ period of repose capital cares nothing for the length of life of labourpower all that concerns it is simply and solely the maximum of labourpower that can be rendered fluent in a working day it attains this end by shortening the extent of the labourer’s life as a greedy farmer snatches increased produce from the soil by robbing it of its fertility the capitalistic mode of production essentially the production of surplusvalue the absorption of surplus labour produces thus with the extension of the working day not only the deterioration of human labourpower by robbing it of its normal moral and physical conditions of development and function it produces also the premature exhaustion and death of this labourpower itself it extends the labourer’s time of production during a given period by shortening his actual lifetime but the value of the labourpower includes the value of the commodities necessary for the reproduction of the worker or for the keeping up of the workingclass if then the unnatural extension of the working day that capital necessarily strives after in its unmeasured passion for selfexpansion shortens the length of life of the individual labourer and therefore the duration of his labourpower the forces used up have to be replaced at a more rapid rate and the sum of the expenses for the reproduction of labourpower will be greater just as in a machine the part of its value to be reproduced every day is greater the more rapidly the machine is worn out it would seem therefore that the interest of capital itself points in the direction of a normal working day the slaveowner buys his labourer as he buys his horse if he loses his slave he loses capital that can only be restored by new outlay in the slavemart but “the ricegrounds of georgia or the swamps of the mississippi may be fatally injurious to the human constitution but the waste of human life which the cultivation of these districts necessitates is not so great that it cannot be repaired from the teeming preserves of virginia and kentucky considerations of economy moreover which under a natural system afford some security for humane treatment by identifying the master’s interest with the slave’s preservation when once trading in slaves is practiced become reasons for racking to the uttermost the toil of the slave for when his place can at once be supplied from foreign preserves the duration of his life becomes a matter of less moment than its productiveness while it lasts it is accordingly a maxim of slave management in slaveimporting countries that the most effective economy is that which takes out of the human chattel in the shortest space of time the utmost amount of exertion it is capable of putting forth it is in tropical culture where annual profits often equal the whole capital of plantations that negro life is most recklessly sacrificed it is the agriculture of the west indies which has been for centuries prolific of fabulous wealth that has engulfed millions of the african race it is in cuba at this day whose revenues are reckoned by millions and whose planters are princes that we see in the servile class the coarsest fare the most exhausting and unremitting toil and even the absolute destruction of a portion of its numbers every year” mutato nomine de te fabula narratur it is of you that the story is told – horace for slavetrade read labourmarket for kentucky and virginia ireland and the agricultural districts of england scotland and wales for africa germany we heard how overwork thinned the ranks of the bakers in london nevertheless the london labourmarket is always overstocked with german and other candidates for death in the bakeries pottery as we saw is one of the shortestlived industries is there any want therefore of potters josiah wedgwood the inventor of modern pottery himself originally a common workman said in before the house of commons that the whole trade employed from to people in the year the population alone of the town centres of this industry in great britain numbered “the cotton trade has existed for ninety years it has existed for three generations of the english race and i believe i may safely say that during that period it has destroyed nine generations of factory operatives” no doubt in certain epochs of feverish activity the labourmarket shows significant gaps in eg but then the manufacturers proposed to the poor law commissioners that they should send the “surpluspopulation” of the agricultural districts to the north with the explanation “that the manufacturers would absorb and use it up” agents were appointed with the consent of the poor law commissioners an office was set up in manchester to which lists were sent of those workpeople in the agricultural districts wanting employment and their names were registered in books the manufacturers attended at these offices and selected such persons as they chose when they had selected such persons as their ‘wants required’ they gave instructions to have them forwarded to manchester and they were sent ticketed like bales of goods by canals or with carriers others tramping on the road and many of them were found on the way lost and halfstarved this system had grown up unto a regular trade this house will hardly believe it but i tell them that this traffic in human flesh was as well kept up they were in effect as regularly sold to these manchester manufacturers as slaves are sold to the cottongrower in the united states in ‘the cotton trade was at its zenith’ the manufacturers again found that they were short of hands they applied to the ‘flesh agents as they are called those agents sent to the southern downs of england to the pastures of dorsetshire to the glades of devonshire to the people tending kine in wiltshire but they sought in vain the surpluspopulation was ‘absorbed’” the bury guardian said on the completion of the french treaty that “ additional hands could be absorbed by lancashire and that or will be needed” after the “flesh agents and subagents” had in vain sought through the agricultural districts “a deputation came up to london and waited on the right hon gentleman mr villiers president of the poor law board with a view of obtaining poor children from certain union houses for the mills of lancashire” what experience shows to the capitalist generally is a constant excess of population ie an excess in relation to the momentary requirements of surplus labourabsorbing capital although this excess is made up of generations of human beings stunted shortlived swiftly replacing each other plucked so to say before maturity and indeed experience shows to the intelligent observer with what swiftness and grip the capitalist mode of production dating historically speaking only from yesterday has seized the vital power of the people by the very root – shows how the degeneration of the industrial population is only retarded by the constant absorption of primitive and physically uncorrupted elements from the country – shows how even the country labourers in spite of fresh air and the principle of natural selection that works so powerfully amongst them and only permits the survival of the strongest are already beginning to die off capital that has such good reasons for denying the sufferings of the legions of workers that surround it is in practice moved as much and as little by the sight of the coming degradation and final depopulation of the human race as by the probable fall of the earth into the sun in every stockjobbing swindle every one knows that some time or other the crash must come but every one hopes that it may fall on the head of his neighbour after he himself has caught the shower of gold and placed it in safety après moi le déluge after me the flood is the watchword of every capitalist and of every capitalist nation hence capital is reckless of the health or length of life of the labourer unless under compulsion from society to the outcry as to the physical and mental degradation the premature death the torture of overwork it answers ought these to trouble us since they increase our profits but looking at things as a whole all this does not indeed depend on the good or ill will of the individual capitalist free competition brings out the inherent laws of capitalist production in the shape of external coercive laws having power over every individual capitalist the establishment of a normal working day is the result of centuries of struggle between capitalist and labourer the history of this struggle shows two opposed tendencies compare eg the english factory legislation of our time with the english labour statutes from the th century to well into the middle of the th whilst the modern factory acts compulsorily shortened the working day the earlier statutes tried to lengthen it by compulsion of course the pretensions of capital in embryo – when beginning to grow it secures the right of absorbing a quantum sufficit sufficient quantity of surplus labour not merely by the force of economic relations but by the help of the state – appear very modest when put face to face with the concessions that growling and struggling it has to make in its adult condition it takes centuries ere the “free” labourer thanks to the development of capitalistic production agrees ie is compelled by social conditions to sell the whole of his active life his very capacity for work for the price of the necessaries of life his birthright for a mess of pottage hence it is natural that the lengthening of the working day which capital from the middle of the th to the end of the th century tries to impose by statemeasures on adult labourers approximately coincides with the shortening of the working day which in the second half of the th century has here and there been effected by the state to prevent the coining of children’s blood into capital that which today eg in the state of massachusetts until recently the freest state of the northamerican republic has been proclaimed as the statutory limit of the labour of children under was in england even in the middle of the th century the normal working day of ablebodied artisans robust labourers athletic blacksmiths the first “statute of labourers” edward iii found its immediate pretext not its cause for legislation of this kind lasts centuries after the pretext for it has disappeared in the great plague that decimated the people so that as a tory writer says “the difficulty of getting men to work on reasonable terms ie at a price that left their employers a reasonable quantity of surplus labour grew to such a height as to be quite intolerable” reasonable wages were therefore fixed by law as well as the limits of the working day the latter point the only one that here interests us is repeated in the statute of henry vii the working day for all artificers and field labourers from march to september ought according to this statute which however could not be enforced to last from in the morning to between and in the evening but the mealtimes consist of hour for breakfast ½ hours for dinner and ½ an hour for “noonmeate” ie exactly twice as much as under the factory acts now in force in winter work was to last from in the morning until dark with the same intervals a statute of elizabeth of leaves the length of the working day for all labourers “hired for daily or weekly wage” untouched but aims at limiting the intervals to ½ hours in the summer or to in the winter dinner is only to last hour and the “afternoonsleep of half an hour” is only allowed between the middle of may and the middle of august for every hour of absence d is to be subtracted from the wage in practice however the conditions were much more favourable to the labourers than in the statutebook william petty the father of political economy and to some extent the founder of statistics says in a work that he published in the last third of the th century “labouringmen then meaning fieldlabourers work hours per diem and make meals per week viz a day for working days and on sundays whereby it is plain that if they could fast on friday nights and dine in one hour and an half whereas they take two from eleven to one thereby thus working more and spending less the abovementioned tax might be raised” was not dr andrew ure right in crying down the hours’ bill of as a retrogression to the times of the dark ages it is true these regulations contained in the statute mentioned by petty apply also to apprentices but the condition of childlabour even at the end of the th century is seen from the following complaint “’tis not their practice in germany as with us in this kingdom to bind an apprentice for seven years three or four is their common standard and the reason is because they are educated from their cradle to something of employment which renders them the more apt and docile and consequently the more capable of attaining to a ripeness and quicker proficiency in business whereas our youth here in england being bred to nothing before they come to be apprentices make a very slow progress and require much longer time wherein to reach the perfection of accomplished artists” still during the greater part of the th century up to the epoch of modern industry and machinism capital in england had not succeeded in seizing for itself by the payment of the weekly value of labourpower the whole week of the labourer with the exception however of the agricultural labourers the fact that they could live for a whole week on the wage of four days did not appear to the labourers a sufficient reason that they should work the other two days for the capitalist one party of english economists in the interest of capital denounces this obstinacy in the most violent manner another party defends the labourers let us listen eg to the contest between postlethwayt whose dictionary of trade then had the same reputation as the kindred works of macculloch and macgregor today and the author already quoted of the “essay on trade and commerce” postlethwayt says among other things “we cannot put an end to those few observations without noticing that trite remark in the mouth of too many that if the industrious poor can obtain enough to maintain themselves in five days they will not work the whole six whence they infer the necessity of even the necessaries of life being made dear by taxes or any other means to compel the working artisan and manufacturer to labour the whole six days in the week without ceasing i must beg leave to differ in sentiment from those great politicians who contend for the perpetual slavery of the working people of this kingdom they forget the vulgar adage all work and no play have not the english boasted of the ingenuity and dexterity of her working artists and manufacturers which have heretofore given credit and reputation to british wares in general what has this been owing to to nothing more probably than the relaxation of the working people in their own way were they obliged to toil the year round the whole six days in the week in a repetition of the same work might it not blunt their ingenuity and render them stupid instead of alert and dexterous and might not our workmen lose their reputation instead of maintaining it by such eternal slavery and what sort of workmanship could we expect from such harddriven animals many of them will execute as much work in four days as a frenchman will in five or six but if englishmen are to be eternal drudges ‘tis to be feared they will degenerate below the frenchmen as our people are famed for bravery in war do we not say that it is owing to good english roast beef and pudding in their bellies as well as their constitutional spirit of liberty and why may not the superior ingenuity and dexterity of our artists and manufacturers be owing to that freedom and liberty to direct themselves in their own way and i hope we shall never have them deprived of such privileges and that good living from whence their ingenuity no less than their courage may proceed” thereupon the author of the “essay on trade and commerce” replies “if the making of every seventh day an holiday is supposed to be of divine institution as it implies the appropriating the other six days to labour” he means capital as we shall soon see “surely it will not be thought cruel to enforce it that mankind in general are naturally inclined to ease and indolence we fatally experience to be true from the conduct of our manufacturing populace who do not labour upon an average above four days in a week unless provisions happen to be very dear put all the necessaries of the poor under one denomination for instance call them all wheat or suppose that the bushel of wheat shall cost five shillings and that he a manufacturer earns a shilling by his labour he then would be obliged to work five days only in a week if the bushel of wheat should cost but four shillings he would be obliged to work but four days but as wages in this kingdom are much higher in proportion to the price of necessaries the manufacturer who labours four days has a surplus of money to live idle with the rest of the week i hope i have said enough to make it appear that the moderate labour of six days in a week is no slavery our labouring people do this and to all appearance are the happiest of all our labouring poor but the dutch do this in manufactures and appear to be a very happy people the french do so when holidays do not intervene but our populace have adopted a notion that as englishmen they enjoy a birthright privilege of being more free and independent than in any country in europe now this idea as far as it may affect the bravery of our troops may be of some use but the less the manufacturing poor have of it certainly the better for themselves and for the state the labouring people should never think themselves independent of their superiors it is extremely dangerous to encourage mobs in a commercial state like ours where perhaps seven parts out of eight of the whole are people with little or no property the cure will not be perfect till our manufacturing poor are contented to labour six days for the same sum which they now earn in four days” to this end and for “extirpating idleness debauchery and excess” promoting a spirit of industry “lowering the price of labour in our manufactories and easing the lands of the heavy burden of poor’s rates” our “faithful eckart” of capital proposes this approved device to shut up such labourers as become dependent on public support in a word paupers in “an ideal workhouse” such ideal workhouse must be made a “house of terror” and not an asylum for the poor “where they are to be plentifully fed warmly and decently clothed and where they do but little work” in this “house of terror” this “ideal workhouse the poor shall work hours in a day allowing proper time for meals in such manner that there shall remain hours of neatlabour” twelve workinghours daily in the ideal workhouse in the “house of terror” of years later in when the english parliament reduced the working day for children of to in four branches of industry to full hours the judgment day of english industry had dawned in when louis bonaparte sought to secure his position with the bourgeoisie by tampering with the legal working day the french working people cried out with one voice “the law that limits the working day to hours is the one good that has remained to us of the legislation of the republic” at zürich the work of children over is limited to hours in aargau in the work of children between and was reduced from ½ to hours in austria in for children between and the same reduction was made “what a progress” since macaulay would shout with exultation the “house of terror” for paupers of which the capitalistic soul of only dreamed was realised a few years later in the shape of a gigantic “workhouse” for the industrial worker himself it is called the factory and the ideal this time fades before the reality section the struggle for a normal working day compulsory limitation by law of the workingtime english factory acts after capital had taken centuries in extending the working day to its normal maximum limit and then beyond this to the limit of the natural day of hours there followed on the birth of machinism and modern industry in the last third of the th century a violent encroachment like that of an avalanche in its intensity and extent all bounds of morals and nature age and sex day and night were broken down even the ideas of day and night of rustic simplicity in the old statutes became so confused that an english judge as late as needed a quite talmudic sagacity to explain “judicially” what was day and what was night capital celebrated its orgies as soon as the workingclass stunned at first by the noise and turmoil of the new system of production recovered in some measure its senses its resistance began and first in the native land of machinism in england for years however the concessions conquered by the workpeople were purely nominal parliament passed labour laws between and but was shrewd enough not to vote a penny for their carrying out for the requisite officials c they remained a dead letter “the fact is that prior to the act of young persons and children were worked all night all day or both ad libitum” a normal working day for modern industry only dates from the factory act of which included cotton wool flax and silk factories nothing is more characteristic of the spirit of capital than the history of the english factory acts from to the act of declares the ordinary factory working day to be from halfpast five in the morning to halfpast eight in the evening and within these limits a period of hours it is lawful to employ young persons ie persons between and years of age at any time of the day provided no one individual young person should work more than hours in any one day except in certain cases especially provided for the th section of the act provided “that there shall be allowed in the course of every day not less than one and a half hours for meals to every such person restricted as hereinbefore provided” the employment of children under with exceptions mentioned later was forbidden the work of children between and was limited to hours a day nightwork ie according to this act work between pm and am was forbidden for all persons between and the lawmakers were so far from wishing to trench on the freedom of capital to exploit adult labourpower or as they called it “the freedom of labour” that they created a special system in order to prevent the factory acts from having a consequence so outrageous “the great evil of the factory system as at present conducted” says the first report of the central board of the commission of june th “has appeared to us to be that it entails the necessity of continuing the labour of children to the utmost length of that of the adults the only remedy for this evil short of the limitation of the labour of adults which would in our opinion create an evil greater than that which is sought to be remedied appears to be the plan of working double sets of children” under the name of system of relays this “plan” was therefore carried out so that eg from am until in the afternoon one set of children between and and from pm to in the evening another set were “put to” c in order to reward the manufacturers for having in the most barefaced way ignored all the acts as to children’s labour passed during the last twentytwo years the pill was yet further gilded for them parliament decreed that after march st no child under after march st no child under and after march st no child under was to work more than eight hours in a factory this “liberalism” so full of consideration for “capital” was the more noteworthy as dr farre sir a carlisle sir b brodie sir c bell mr guthrie c in a word the most distinguished physicians and surgeons in london had declared in their evidence before the house of commons that there was danger in delay dr farre expressed himself still more coarsely “legislation is necessary for the prevention of death in any form in which it can be prematurely inflicted and certainly this ie the factory method must be viewed as a most cruel mode of inflicting it” that same “reformed” parliament which in its delicate consideration for the manufacturers condemned children under for years to come to hours of work per week in the factory hell on the other hand in the emancipation act which also administered freedom drop by drop forbade the planters from the outset to work any negro slave more than hours a week but in no wise conciliated capital now began a noisy agitation that went on for several years it turned chiefly on the age of those who under the name of children were limited to hours’ work and were subject to a certain amount of compulsory education according to capitalistic anthropology the age of childhood ended at or at the outside at the more nearly the time approached for the coming into full force of the factory act the fatal year the more wildly raged the mob of manufacturers they managed in fact to intimidate the government to such an extent that in it proposed to lower the limit of the age of childhood from to in the meantime the pressure from without grew more threatening courage failed the house of commons it refused to throw children of under the juggernaut car of capital for more than hours a day and the act of came into full operation it remained unaltered until june in the ten years during which it regulated factory work first in part and then entirely the official reports of the factory inspectors teem with complaints as to the impossibility of putting the act into force as the law of left it optional with the lords of capital during the hours from am to pm to make every “young person” and every “child” begin break off resume or end his or hours at any moment they liked and also permitted them to assign to different persons different times for meals these gentlemen soon discovered a new “system of relays” by which the labourhorses were not changed at fixed stations but were constantly reharnessed at changing stations we do not pause longer on the beauty of this system as we shall have to return to it later but this much is clear at the first glance that this system annulled the whole factory act not only in the spirit but in the letter how could factory inspectors with this complex bookkeeping in respect to each individual child or young person enforce the legally determined worktime and the granting of the legal mealtimes in a great many of the factories the old brutalities soon blossomed out again unpunished in an interview with the home secretary the factory inspectors demonstrated the impossibility of any control under the newly invented relay system in the meantime however circumstances had greatly changed the factory hands especially since had made the ten hours’ bill their economic as they had made the charter their political electioncry some of the manufacturers even who had managed their factories in conformity with the act of overwhelmed parliament with memorials on the immoral competition of their false brethren whom greater impudence or more fortunate local circumstances enabled to break the law moreover however much the individual manufacturer might give the rein to his old lust for gain the spokesmen and political leaders of the manufacturing class ordered a change of front and of speech towards the workpeople they had entered upon the contest for the repeal of the corn laws and needed the workers to help them to victory they promised therefore not only a doublesized loaf of bread but the enactment of the ten hours’ bill in the freetrade millennium thus they still less dared to oppose a measure intended only to make the law of a reality threatened in their holiest interest the rent of land the tories thundered with philanthropic indignation against the “nefarious practices” of their foes this was the origin of the additional factory act of june th it came into effect on september th it places under protection a new category of workers viz the women over they were placed in every respect on the same footing as the young persons their work time limited to twelve hours their nightlabour forbidden c for the first time legislation saw itself compelled to control directly and officially the labour of adults in the factory report of it is said with irony “no instances have come to my knowledge of adult women having expressed any regret at their rights being thus far interfered with” the workingtime of children under was reduced to ½ and in certain circumstances to hours aday to get rid of the abuses of the “spurious relay system” the law established besides others the following important regulations – “that the hours of work of children and young persons shall be reckoned from the time when any child or young person shall begin to work in the morning” so that if a eg begins work at in the morning and b at b’s workday must nevertheless end at the same hour as a’s “the time shall be regulated by a public clock” for example the nearest railway clock by which the factory clock is to be set the occupier is to hang up a “legible” printed notice stating the hours for the beginning and ending of work and the times allowed for the several meals children beginning work before noon may not be again employed after pm the afternoon shift must therefore consist of other children than those employed in the morning of the hour and a half for mealtimes “one hour thereof at the least shall be given before three of the clock in the afternoon and at the same period of the day no child or young person shall be employed more than five hours before pm without an interval for mealtime of at least minutes no child or young person or female shall be employed or allowed to remain in any room in which any manufacturing process is then ie at mealtimes carried on” c it has been seen that these minutiae which with military uniformity regulate by stroke of the clock the times limits pauses of the work were not at all the products of parliamentary fancy they developed gradually out of circumstances as natural laws of the modern mode of production their formulation official recognition and proclamation by the state were the result of a long struggle of classes one of their first consequences was that in practice the working day of the adult males in factories became subject to the same limitations since in most processes of production the cooperation of the children young persons and women is indispensable on the whole therefore during the period from to the hours’ working day became general and uniform in all branches of industry under the factory act the manufacturers however did not allow this “progress” without a compensating “retrogression” at their instigation the house of commons reduced the minimum age for exploitable children from to in order to assure that additional supply of factory children which is due to capitalists according to divine and human law the years are epochmaking in the economic history of england the repeal of the corn laws and of the duties on cotton and other raw material freetrade proclaimed as the guiding star of legislation in a word the arrival of the millennium on the other hand in the same years the chartist movement and the hours’ agitation reached their highest point they found allies in the tories panting for revenge despite the fanatical opposition of the army of perjured freetraders with bright and cobden at their head the ten hours’ bill struggled for so long went through parliament the new factory act of june th enacted that on july st there should be a preliminary shortening of the working day for “young persons” from to and all females to hours but that on may st there should be a definite limitation of the working day to hours in other respects the act only amended and completed the acts of and capital now entered upon a preliminary campaign in order to hinder the act from coming into full force on may st and the workers themselves under the presence that they had been taught by experience were to help in the destruction of their own work the moment was cleverly chosen “it must be remembered too that there has been more than two years of great suffering in consequence of the terrible crisis of among the factory operatives from many mills having worked short time and many being altogether closed a considerable number of the operatives must therefore be in very narrow circumstances many it is to be feared in debt so that it might fairly have been presumed that at the present time they would prefer working the longer time in order to make up for past losses perhaps to pay off debts or get their furniture out of pawn or replace that sold or to get a new supply of clothes for themselves and their families” the manufacturers tried to aggravate the natural effect of these circumstances by a general reduction of wages by this was done so to say to celebrate the inauguration of the new freetrade era then followed a further reduction of as soon as the working day was shortened to and a reduction of double that amount as soon as it was finally shortened to hours wherever therefore circumstances allowed it a reduction of wages of at least took place under such favourably prepared conditions the agitation among the factory workers for the repeal of the act of was begun neither lies bribery nor threats were spared in this attempt but all was in vain concerning the halfdozen petitions in which workpeople were made to complain of “their oppression by the act” the petitioners themselves declared under oral examination that their signatures had been extorted from them “they felt themselves oppressed but not exactly by the factory act” but if the manufacturers did not succeed in making the workpeople speak as they wished they themselves shrieked all the louder in press and parliament in the name of the workpeople they denounced the factory inspectors as a kind of revolutionary commissioners like those of the french national convention ruthlessly sacrificing the unhappy factory workers to their humanitarian crotchet this manoeuvre also failed factory inspector leonard horner conducted in his own person and through his subinspectors many examinations of witnesses in the factories of lancashire about of the workpeople examined declared in favour of hours a much smaller percentage in favour of and an altogether insignificant minority for the old hours another “friendly” dodge was to make the adult males work to hours and then to blazon abroad this fact as the best proof of what the proletariat desired in its heart of hearts but the “ruthless” factory inspector leonard horner was again to the fore the majority of the “overtimes” declared “they would much prefer working ten hours for less wages but that they had no choice that so many were out of employment so many spinners getting very low wages by having to work as piecers being unable to do better that if they refused to work the longer time others would immediately get their places so that it was a question with them of agreeing to work the longer time or of being thrown out of employment altogether” the preliminary campaign of capital thus came to grief and the ten hours’ act came into force may st but meanwhile the fiasco of the chartist party whose leaders were imprisoned and whose organisation was dismembered had shaken the confidence of the english workingclass in its own strength soon after this the june insurrection in paris and its bloody suppression united in england as on the continent all fractions of the ruling classes landlords and capitalists stockexchange wolves and shopkeepers protectionists and freetraders government and opposition priests and freethinkers young whores and old nuns under the common cry for the salvation of property religion the family and society the workingclass was everywhere proclaimed placed under a ban under a virtual law of suspects the manufacturers had no need any longer to restrain themselves they broke out in open revolt not only against the ten hours’ act but against the whole of the legislation that since had aimed at restricting in some measure the “free” exploitation of labourpower it was a proslavery rebellion in miniature carried on for over two years with a cynical recklessness a terrorist energy all the cheaper because the rebel capitalist risked nothing except the skin of his “hands” to understand that which follows we must remember that the factory acts of and were all three in force so far as the one did not amend the other that not one of these limited the working day of the male worker over and that since the hours from am to pm had remained the legal “day” within the limits of which at first the and later the hours’ labour of young persons and women had to be performed under the prescribed conditions the manufacturers began by here and there discharging a part of in many cases half of the young persons and women employed by them and then for the adult males restoring the almost obsolete nightwork the ten hours’ act they cried leaves no other alternative their second step dealt with the legal pauses for meals let us hear the factory inspectors “since the restriction of the hours of work to ten the factory occupiers maintain although they have not yet practically gone the whole length that supposing the hours of work to be from am to pm they fulfil the provisions of the statutes by allowing an hour before am and half an hour after pm for meals in some cases they now allow an hour or half an hour for dinner insisting at the same time that they are not bound to allow any part of the hour and a half in the course of the factory working day” the manufacturers maintained therefore that the scrupulously strict provisions of the act of with regard to mealtimes only gave the operatives permission to eat and drink before coming into and after leaving the factory – ie at home and why should not the workpeople eat their dinner before in the morning the crown lawyers however decided that the prescribed mealtimes “must be in the interval during the workinghours and that it will not be lawful to work for hours continuously from am to pm without any interval” after these pleasant demonstrations capital preluded its revolt by a step which agreed with the letter of the law of and was therefore legal the act of certainly prohibited the employment after pm of such children from to as had been employed before noon but it did not regulate in any way the ½ hours’ work of the children whose worktime began at midday or later children of might if they began work at noon be employed from to hour from to in the afternoon hours from to in the evening ½ hours in all the legal ½ hours or better still in order to make their work coincide with that of the adult male labourers up to pm the manufacturers only had to give them no work till in the afternoon they could then keep them in the factory without intermission till in the evening “and it is now expressly admitted that the practice exists in england from the desire of millowners to have their machinery at work for more than hours aday to keep the children at work with male adults after all the young persons and women have left and until pm if the factoryowners choose” workmen and factory inspectors protested on hygienic and moral grounds but capital answered “my deeds upon my head i crave the law the penalty and forfeit of my bond” in fact according to statistics laid before the house of commons on july th in spite of all protests on july th children were subjected to this “practice” in factories still this was not enough the lynx eye of capital discovered that the act of did not allow hours’ work before midday without a pause of at least minutes for refreshment but prescribed nothing of the kind for work after midday therefore it claimed and obtained the enjoyment not only of making children of drudge without intermission from to pm but also of making them hunger during that time “ay his breast so says the bond” this shylockclinging to the letter of the law of so far as it regulated children’s labour was but to lead up to an open revolt against the same law so far as it regulated the labour of “young persons and women” it will be remembered that the abolition of the “false relay system” was the chief aim and object of that law the masters began their revolt with the simple declaration that the sections of the act of which prohibited the ad libitum use of young persons and women in such short fractions of the day of hours as the employer chose were “comparatively harmless” so long as the worktime was fixed at hours but under the ten hours’ act they were a “grievous hardship” they informed the inspectors in the coolest manner that they should place themselves above the letter of the law and reintroduce the old system on their own account they were acting in the interests of the illadvised operatives themselves “in order to be able to pay them higher wages” this was the only possible plan by which to maintain under the ten hours’ act the industrial supremacy of great britain” “perhaps it may be a little difficult to detect irregularities under the relay system but what of that is the great manufacturing interest of this country to be treated as a secondary matter in order to save some little trouble to inspectors and subinspectors of factories” all these shifts naturally were of no avail the factory inspectors appealed to the law courts but soon such a cloud of dust in the way of petitions from the masters overwhelmed the home secretary sir george grey that in a circular of august th he recommends the inspectors not “to lay informations against millowners for a breach of the letter of the act or for employment of young persons by relays in cases in which there is no reason to believe that such young persons have been actually employed for a longer period than that sanctioned by law” hereupon factory inspector j stuart allowed the socalled relay system during the hours of the factory day throughout scotland where it soon flourished again as of old the english factory inspectors on the other hand declared that the home secretary had no power dictatorially to suspend the law and continued their legal proceedings against the proslavery rebellion but what was the good of summoning the capitalists when the courts in this case the county magistrates – cobbett’s “great unpaid” – acquitted them in these tribunals the masters sat in judgment on themselves an example one eskrigge cottonspinner of the firm of kershaw leese co had laid before the factory inspector of his district the scheme of a relay system intended for his mill receiving a refusal he at first kept quiet a few months later an individual named robinson also a cottonspinner and if not his man friday at all events related to eskrigge appeared before the borough magistrates of stockport on a charge of introducing the identical plan of relays invented by eskrigge four justices sat among them three cottonspinners at their head this same inevitable eskrigge eskrigge acquitted robinson and now was of opinion that what was right for robinson was fair for eskrigge supported by his own legal decision he introduced the system at once into his own factory of course the composition of this tribunal was in itself a violation of the law these judicial farces exclaims inspector howell “urgently call for a remedy – either that the law should be so altered as to be made to conform to these decisions or that it should be administered by a less fallible tribunal whose decisions would conform to the law when these cases are brought forward i long for a stipendiary magistrate” the crown lawyers declared the masters’ interpretation of the act of absurd but the saviours of society would not allow themselves to be turned from their purpose leonard horner reports “having endeavoured to enforce the act by ten prosecutions in seven magisterial divisions and having been supported by the magistrates in one case only i considered it useless to prosecute more for this evasion of the law that part of the act of which was framed for securing uniformity in the hours of work is thus no longer in force in my district lancashire neither have the subinspectors or myself any means of satisfying ourselves when we inspect a mill working by shifts that the young persons and women are not working more than hours aday in a return of the th april of millowners working by shifts the number amounts to and has been for some time rapidly increasing in general the time of working the mill is extended to ½ hours’ from am to ½ pm in some instances it amounts to hours from ½ am to ½ pm” already in december leonard horner had a list of manufacturers and overlookers who unanimously declared that no system of supervision could under this relay system prevent enormous overwork now the same children and young persons were shifted from the spinningroom to the weavingroom now during hours from one factory to another how was it possible to control a system which “under the guise of relays is some one of the many plans for shuffling ‘the hands’ about in endless variety and shifting the hours of work and of rest for different individuals throughout the day so that you may never have one complete set of hands working together in the same room at the same time” but altogether independently of actual overwork this socalled relay system was an offspring of capitalistic fantasy such as fourier in his humorous sketches of “courses seances” has never surpassed except that the “attraction of labour” was changed into the attraction of capital look for example at those schemes of the masters which the “respectable” press praised as models of “what a reasonable degree of care and method can accomplish” the personnel of the workpeople was sometimes divided into from to categories which themselves constantly changed and recharged their constituent parts during the hours of the factory day capital dragged in the labourer now for minutes now for an hour and then pushed him out again to drag him into the factory and to thrust him out afresh hounding him hither and thither in scattered shreds of time without ever losing hold of him until the full hours’ work was done as on the stage the same persons had to appear in turns in the different scenes of the different acts but as an actor during the whole course of the play belongs to the stage so the operatives during hours belonged to the factory without reckoning the time for going and coming thus the hours of rest were turned into hours of enforced idleness which drove the youths to the pothouse and the girls to the brothel at every new trick that the capitalist from day to day hit upon for keeping his machinery going or hours without increasing the number of his hands the worker had to swallow his meals now in this fragment of time now in that at the time of the hours’ agitation the masters cried out that the working mob petitioned in the hope of obtaining hours’ wages for hours’ work now they reversed the medal they paid hours’ wages for or hours’ lordship over labourpower this was the gist of the matter this the masters’ interpretation of the hours’ law these were the same unctuous freetraders perspiring with the love of humanity who for full years during the anticorn law agitation had preached to the operatives by a reckoning of pounds shillings and pence that with free importation of corn and with the means possessed by english industry hours’ labour would be quite enough to enrich the capitalists this revolt of capital after two years was at last crowned with victory by a decision of one of the four highest courts of justice in england the court of exchequer which in a case brought before it on february th decided that the manufacturers were certainly acting against the sense of the act of but that this act itself contained certain words that rendered it meaningless “by this decision the ten hours’ act was abolished” a crowd of masters who until then had been afraid of using the relay system for young persons and women now took it up heart and soul but on this apparently decisive victory of capital followed at once a revulsion the workpeople had hitherto offered a passive although inflexible and unremitting resistance they now protested in lancashire and yorkshire in threatening meetings the pretended ten hours’ act was thus simple humbug parliamentary cheating had never existed the factory inspectors urgently warned the government that the antagonism of classes had arrived at an incredible tension some of the masters themselves murmured “on account of the contradictory decisions of the magistrates a condition of things altogether abnormal and anarchical obtains one law holds in yorkshire another in lancashire one law in one parish of lancashire another in its immediate neighbourhood the manufacturer in large towns could evade the law the manufacturer in country districts could not find the people necessary for the relay system still less for the shifting of hands from one factory to another” c and the first birthright of capital is equal exploitation of labourpower by all capitalists under these circumstances a compromise between masters and men was effected that received the seal of parliament in the additional factory act of august th the working day for “young persons and women” was raised from to ½ hours for the first five days of the week and shortened to ½ on the saturday the work was to go on between am and pm with pauses of not less than ½ hours for mealtimes these mealtimes to be allowed at one and the same time for all and conformably to the conditions of by this an end was put to the relay system once for all for children’s labour the act of remained in force one set of masters this time as before secured to itself special seigneurial rights over the children of the proletariat these were the silk manufacturers in they had howled out in threatening fashion “if the liberty of working children of any age for hours a day were taken away it would stop their works” it would be impossible for them to buy a sufficient number of children over they extorted the privilege they desired the pretext was shown on subsequent investigation to be a deliberate lie it did not however prevent them during years from spinning silk hours a day out of the blood of little children who had to be placed upon stools for the performance of their work the act of certainly “robbed” them of the “liberty” of employing children under longer than ½ hours a day but it secured to them on the other hand the privilege of working children between and hours a day and of annulling in their case the education made compulsory for all other factory children this time the pretext was “the delicate texture of the fabric in which they were employed requiring a lightness of touch only to be acquired by their early introduction to these factories” the children were slaughtered outandout for the sake of their delicate fingers as in southern russia the horned cattle for the sake of their hide and tallow at length in the privilege granted in was limited to the departments of silktwisting and silkwinding but here to make amends to capital bereft of its “freedom” the worktime for children from to was raised from to ½ hours pretext “labour in silk mills was lighter than in mills for other fabrics and less likely in other respects also to be prejudicial to health” official medical inquiries proved afterwards that on the contrary “the average deathrate is exceedingly high in the silk districts and amongst the female part of the population is higher even than it is in the cotton districts of lancashire” despite the protests of the factory inspector renewed every months the mischief continues to this hour the act of changed the hours’ time from am to pm into the hours from am to pm for “young persons and women” only it did not therefore affect children who could always be employed for half an hour before and ½ hours after this period provided the whole of their labour did not exceed ½ hours whilst the bill was under discussion the factory inspectors laid before parliament statistics of the infamous abuses due to this anomaly to no purpose in the background lurked the intention of screwing up during prosperous years the working day of adult males to hours by the aid of the children the experience of the three following years showed that such an attempt must come to grief against the resistance of the adult male operatives the act of was therefore finally completed in by forbidding the “employment of children in the morning before and in the evening after young persons and women” henceforth with a few exceptions the factory act of regulated the working day of all workers in the branches of industry that come under it since the passing of the first factory act half a century had elapsed factory legislation for the first time went beyond its original sphere in the “printworks’ act of ” the displeasure with which capital received this new “extravagance” speaks through every line of the act it limits the working day for children from to and for women to hours between am and pm without any legal pause for mealtimes it allows males over to be worked at will day and night it is a parliamentary abortion however the principle had triumphed with its victory in those great branches of industry which form the most characteristic creation of the modern mode of production their wonderful development from to handinhand with the physical and moral regeneration of the factory workers struck the most purblind the masters from whom the legal limitation and regulation had been wrung step by step after a civil war of half a century themselves referred ostentatiously to the contrast with the branches of exploitation still “free” the pharisees of “political economy” now proclaimed the discernment of the necessity of a legally fixed working day as a characteristic new discovery of their “science” it will be easily understood that after the factory magnates had resigned themselves and become reconciled to the inevitable the power of resistance of capital gradually weakened whilst at the same time the power of attack of the workingclass grew with the number of its allies in the classes of society not immediately interested in the question hence the comparatively rapid advance since the dyeworks and bleachworks all came under the factory act of in lace and stocking manufactures in in consequence of the first report of the commission on the employment of children the same fate was shared by the manufacturers of all earthenwares not merely pottery lucifermatches percussion caps cartridges carpets fustiancutting and many processes included under the name of “finishing” in the year bleaching in the open air and baking were placed under special acts by which in the former the labour of young persons and women during the nighttime from in the evening to in the morning and in the latter the employment of journeymen bakers under between in the evening and in the morning were forbidden we shall return to the later proposals of the same commission which threatened to deprive of their “freedom” all the important branches of english industry with the exception of agriculture mines and the means of transport section the struggle for a normal working day reaction of the english factory acts on other countries the reader will bear in mind that the production of surplusvalue or the extraction of surplus labour is the specific end and aim the sum and substance of capitalist production quite apart from any changes in the mode of production which may arise from the subordination of labour to capital he will remember that as far as we have at present gone only the independent labourer and therefore only the labourer legally qualified to act for himself enters as a vendor of a commodity into a contract with the capitalist if therefore in our historical sketch on the one hand modern industry on the other the labour of those who are physically and legally minors play important parts the former was to us only a special department and the latter only a specially striking example of labour exploitation without however anticipating the subsequent development of our inquiry from the mere connexion of the historic facts before us it follows first the passion of capital for an unlimited and reckless extension of the working day is first gratified in the industries earliest revolutionised by waterpower steam and machinery in those first creations of the modern mode of production cotton wool flax and silk spinning and weaving the changes in the material mode of production and the corresponding changes in the social relations of the producers gave rise first to an extravagance beyond all bounds and then in opposition to this called forth a control on the part of society which legally limits regulates and makes uniform the working day and its pauses this control appears therefore during the first half of the nineteenth century simply as exceptional legislation as soon as this primitive dominion of the new mode of production was conquered it was found that in the meantime not only had many other branches of production been made to adopt the same factory system but that manufactures with more or less obsolete methods such as potteries glassmaking c that oldfashioned handicrafts like baking and finally even that the socalled domestic industries such as nailmaking had long since fallen as completely under capitalist exploitation as the factories themselves legislation was therefore compelled to gradually get rid of its exceptional character or where as in england it proceeds after the manner of the roman casuists to declare any house in which work was done to be a factory second the history of the regulation of the working day in certain branches of production and the struggle still going on in others in regard to this regulation prove conclusively that the isolated labourer the labourer as “free” vendor of his labourpower when capitalist production has once attained a certain stage succumbs without any power of resistance the creation of a normal working day is therefore the product of a protracted civil war more or less dissembled between the capitalist class and the workingclass as the contest takes place in the arena of modern industry it first breaks out in the home of that industry – england the english factory workers were the champions not only of the english but of the modern workingclass generally as their theorists were the first to throw down the gauntlet to the theory of capital hence the philosopher of the factory ure denounces as an ineffable disgrace to the english workingclass that they inscribed “the slavery of the factory acts” on the banner which they bore against capital manfully striving for “perfect freedom of labour” france limps slowly behind england the february revolution was necessary to bring into the world the hours’ law which is much more deficient than its english original for all that the french revolutionary method has its special advantages it once for all commands the same limit to the working day in all shops and factories without distinction whilst english legislation reluctantly yields to the pressure of circumstances now on this point now on that and is getting lost in a hopelessly bewildering tangle of contradictory enactments on the other hand the french law proclaims as a principle that which in england was only won in the name of children minors and women and has been only recently for the first time claimed as a general right in the united states of north america every independent movement of the workers was paralysed so long as slavery disfigured a part of the republic labour cannot emancipate itself in the white skin where in the black it is branded but out of the death of slavery a new life at once arose the first fruit of the civil war was the eight hours’ agitation that ran with the sevenleagued boots of the locomotive from the atlantic to the pacific from new england to california the general congress of labour at baltimore august th declared “the first and great necessity of the present to free the labour of this country from capitalistic slavery is the passing of a law by which eight hours shall be the normal working day in all states of the american union we are resolved to put forth all our strength until this glorious result is attained” at the same time the congress of the international working men’s association at geneva on the proposition of the london general council resolved that “the limitation of the working day is a preliminary condition without which all further attempts at improvement and emancipation must prove abortive the congress proposes eight hours as the legal limit of the working day” thus the movement of the workingclass on both sides of the atlantic that had grown instinctively out of the conditions of production themselves endorsed the words of the english factory inspector r j saunders “further steps towards a reformation of society can never be carried out with any hope of success unless the hours of labour be limited and the prescribed limit strictly enforced” it must be acknowledged that our labourer comes out of the process of production other than he entered in the market he stood as owner of the commodity “labourpower” face to face with other owners of commodities dealer against dealer the contract by which he sold to the capitalist his labourpower proved so to say in black and white that he disposed of himself freely the bargain concluded it is discovered that he was no “free agent” that the time for which he is free to sell his labourpower is the time for which he is forced to sell it that in fact the vampire will not lose its hold on him “so long as there is a muscle a nerve a drop of blood to be exploited” for “protection” against “the serpent of their agonies” the labourers must put their heads together and as a class compel the passing of a law an allpowerful social barrier that shall prevent the very workers from selling by voluntary contract with capital themselves and their families into slavery and death in place of the pompous catalogue of the “inalienable rights of man” comes the modest magna charta of a legally limited working day which shall make clear “when the time which the worker sells is ended and when his own begins” quantum mutatus ab illo what a great change from that time – virgil chapter rate and mass of surplusvalue in this chapter as hitherto the value of labourpower and therefore the part of the working day necessary for the reproduction or maintenance of that labourpower are supposed to be given constant magnitudes this premised with the rate the mass is at the same time given of the surplusvalue that the individual labourer furnishes to the capitalist in a definite period of time if eg the necessary labour amounts to hours daily expressed in a quantum of gold shillings then s is the daily value of one labourpower or the value of the capital advanced in the buying of one labourpower if further the rate of surplusvalue be this variable capital of s produces a mass of surplusvalue of s or the labourer supplies daily a mass of surplus labour equal to hours but the variable capital of a capitalist is the expression in money of the total value of all the labourpowers that he employs simultaneously its value is therefore equal to the average value of one labourpower multiplied by the number of labourpowers employed with a given value of labourpower therefore the magnitude of the variable capital varies directly as the number of labourers employed simultaneously if the daily value of one labourpower s then a capital of s must be advanced in order to exploit daily labourpowers of n times s in order to exploit daily n labourpowers in the same way if a variable capital of s being the daily value of one labourpower produce a daily surplusvalue of s a variable capital of s will produce a daily surplusvalue of s and one of n times s a daily surplusvalue of n × s the mass of the surplusvalue produced is therefore equal to the surplusvalue which the working day of one labourer supplies multiplied by the number of labourers employed but as further the mass of surplusvalue which a single labourer produces the value of labourpower being given is determined by the rate of the surplusvalue this law follows the mass of the surplusvalue produced is equal to the amount of the variable capital advanced multiplied by the rate of surplusvalue in other words it is determined by the compound ratio between the number of labourpowers exploited simultaneously by the same capitalist and the degree of exploitation of each individual labourpower let the mass of the surplusvalue be s the surplusvalue supplied by the individual labourer in the average day s the variable capital daily advanced in the purchase of one individual labourpower v the sum total of the variable capital v the value of an average labourpower p its degree of exploitation aa surplus labournecessarylabour and the number of labourers employed n we would have s sv × v p × aa × n it is always supposed not only that the value of an average labourpower is constant but that the labourers employed by a capitalist are reduced to average labourers there are exceptional cases in which the surplusvalue produced does not increase in proportion to the number of labourers exploited but then the value of the labourpower does not remain constant in the production of a definite mass of surplusvalue therefore the decrease of one factor may be compensated by the increase of the other if the variable capital diminishes and at the same time the rate of surplusvalue increases in the same ratio the mass of surplusvalue produced remains unaltered if on our earlier assumption the capitalist must advance s in order to exploit labourers a day and if the rate of surplusvalue amounts to this variable capital of s yields a surplusvalue of s or of × working hours if the rate of surplusvalue doubles or the working day instead of being extended from to is extended from to hours and at the same time variable capital is lessened by half and reduced to s it yields also a surplusvalue of s or × working hours diminution of the variable capital may therefore be compensated by a proportionate rise in the degree of exploitation of labourpower or the decrease in the number of the labourers employed by a proportionate extension of the working day within certain limits therefore the supply of labour exploitable by capital is independent of the supply of labourers on the contrary a fall in the rate of surplusvalue leaves unaltered the mass of the surplusvalue produced if the amount of the variable capital or number of the labourers employed increases in the same proportion nevertheless the compensation of a decrease in the number of labourers employed or of the amount of variable capital advanced by a rise in the rate of surplusvalue or by the lengthening of the working day has impassable limits whatever the value of labourpower may be whether the working time necessary for the maintenance of the labourer is or hours the total value that a labourer can produce day in day out is always less than the value in which hours of labour are embodied less than s if s is the money expression for hours of realised labour in our former assumption according to which working hours are daily necessary in order to reproduce the labourpower itself or to replace the value of the capital advanced in its purchase a variable capital of s that employs labourers at a rate of surplusvalue of with a hours’ working day produces daily a surplusvalue of s or of × working hours a capital of s that employs labourers a day with a rate of surplusvalue of or with a working day of hours produces only a mass of surplusvalue of s or × working hours and its total valueproduct the equivalent of the variable capital advanced plus the surplusvalue can day in day out never reach the sum of s or × working hours the absolute limit of the average working day – this being by nature always less than hours – sets an absolute limit to the compensation of a reduction of variable capital by a higher rate of surplusvalue or of the decrease of the number of labourers exploited by a higher degree of exploitation of labourpower this palpable law is of importance for the clearing up of many phenomena arising from a tendency to be worked out later on of capital to reduce as much as possible the number of labourers employed by it or its variable constituent transformed into labourpower in contradiction to its other tendency to produce the greatest possible mass of surplusvalue on the other hand if the mass of labourpower employed or the amount of variable capital increases but not in proportion to the fall in the rate of surplusvalue the mass of the surplusvalue produced falls a third law results from the determination of the mass of the surplusvalue produced by the two factors rate of surplusvalue and amount of variable capital advanced the rate of surplusvalue or the degree of exploitation of labourpower and the value of labourpower or the amount of necessary working time being given it is self evident that the greater the variable capital the greater would be the mass of the value produced and of the surplusvalue if the limit of the working day is given and also the limit of its necessary constituent the mass of value and surplusvalue that an individual capitalist produces is clearly exclusively dependent on the mass of labour that he sets in motion but this under the conditions supposed above depends on the mass of labourpower or the number of labourers whom he exploits and this number in its turn is determined by the amount of the variable capital advanced with a given rate of surplusvalue and a given value of labourpower therefore the masses of surplusvalue produced vary directly as the amounts of the variable capitals advanced now we know that the capitalist divides his capital into two parts one part he lays out in means of production this is the constant part of his capital the other part he lays out in living labourpower this part forms his variable capital on the basis of the same mode of social production the division of capital into constant and variable differs in different branches of production and within the same branch of production too this relation changes with changes in the technical conditions and in the social combinations of the processes of production but in whatever proportion a given capital breaks up into a constant and a variable part whether the latter is to the former as or or x the law just laid down is not affected by this for according to our previous analysis the value of the constant capital reappears in the value of the product but does not enter into the newly produced value the newly created value product to employ spinners more raw material spindles c are of course required than to employ the value of these additional means of production however may rise fall remain unaltered be large or small it has no influence on the process of creation of surplusvalue by means of the labourpowers that put them in motion the law demonstrated above now therefore takes this form the masses of value and of surplusvalue produced by different capitals – the value of labourpower being given and its degree of exploitation being equal – vary directly as the amounts of the variable constituents of these capitals ie as their constituents transformed into living labourpower this law clearly contradicts all experience based on appearance everyone knows that a cotton spinner who reckoning the percentage on the whole of his applied capital employs much constant and little variable capital does not on account of this pocket less profit or surplusvalue than a baker who relatively sets in motion much variable and little constant capital for the solution of this apparent contradiction many intermediate terms are as yet wanted as from the standpoint of elementary algebra many intermediate terms are wanted to understand that may represent an actual magnitude classical economy although not formulating the law holds instinctively to it because it is a necessary consequence of the general law of value it tries to rescue the law from collision with contradictory phenomena by a violent abstraction it will be seen later how the school of ricardo has come to grief over this stumbling block vulgar economy which indeed “has really learnt nothing” here as everywhere sticks to appearances in opposition to the law which regulates and explains them in opposition to spinoza it believes that “ignorance is a sufficient reason” the labour which is set in motion by the total capital of a society day in day out may be regarded as a single collective working day if eg the number of labourers is a million and the average working day of a labourer is hours the social working day consists of ten million hours with a given length of this working day whether its limits are fixed physically or socially the mass of surplusvalue can only be increased by increasing the number of labourers ie of the labouring population the growth of population here forms the mathematical limit to the production of surplusvalue by the total social capital on the contrary with a given amount of population this limit is formed by the possible lengthening of the workingday it will however be seen in the following chapter that this law only holds for the form of surplusvalue dealt with up to the present from the treatment of the production of surplusvalue so far it follows that not every sum of money or of value is at pleasure transformable into capital to effect this transformation in fact a certain minimum of money or of exchangevalue must be presupposed in the hands of the individual possessor of money or commodities the minimum of variable capital is the cost price of a single labourpower employed the whole year through day in day out for the production of surplusvalue if this labourer were in possession of his own means of production and were satisfied to live as a labourer he need not work beyond the time necessary for the reproduction of his means of subsistence say hours a day he would besides only require the means of production sufficient for working hours the capitalist on the other hand who makes him do besides these hours say hours’ surplus labour requires an additional sum of money for furnishing the additional means of production on our supposition however he would have to employ two labourers in order to live on the surplusvalue appropriated daily as well as and no better than a labourer ie to be able to satisfy his necessary wants in this case the mere maintenance of life would be the end of his production not the increase of wealth but this latter is implied in capitalist production that he may live only twice as well as an ordinary labourer and besides turn half of the surplusvalue produced into capital he would have to raise with the number of labourers the minimum of the capital advanced times of course he can like his labourer take to work himself participate directly in the process of production but he is then only a hybrid between capitalist and labourer a “small master” a certain stage of capitalist production necessitates that the capitalist be able to devote the whole of the time during which he functions as a capitalist ie as personified capital to the appropriation and therefore control of the labour of others and to the selling of the products of this labour the guilds of the middle ages therefore tried to prevent by force the transformation of the master of a trade into a capitalist by limiting the number of labourers that could be employed by one master within a very small maximum the possessor of money or commodities actually turns into a capitalist in such cases only where the minimum sum advanced for production greatly exceeds the maximum of the middle ages here as in natural science is shown the correctness of the law discovered by hegel in his “logic” that merely quantitative differences beyond a certain point pass into qualitative changes the minimum of the sum of value that the individual possessor of money or commodities must command in order to metamorphose himself into a capitalist changes with the different stages of development of capitalist production and is at given stages different in different spheres of production according to their special and technical conditions certain spheres of production demand even at the very outset of capitalist production a minimum of capital that is not as yet found in the hands of single individuals this gives rise partly to state subsidies to private persons as in france in the time of clobber and as in many german states up to our own epoch partly to the formation of societies with legal monopoly for the exploitation of certain branches of industry and commerce the forerunners of our modern joint stock companies within the process of production as we have seen capital acquired the command over labour ie over functioning labourpower or the labourer himself personified capital the capitalist takes care that the labourer does his work regularly and with the proper degree of intensity capital further developed into a coercive relation which compels the working class to do more work than the narrow round of its own lifewants prescribes as a producer of the activity of others as a pumperout of surplus labour and exploiter of labourpower it surpasses in energy disregard of bounds recklessness and efficiency all earlier systems of production based on directly compulsory labour at first capital subordinates labour on the basis of the technical conditions in which it historically finds it it does not therefore change immediately the mode of production the production of surplusvalue – in the form hitherto considered by us – by means of simple extension of the working day proved therefore to be independent of any change in the mode of production itself it was not less active in the oldfashioned bakeries than in the modern cotton factories if we consider the process of production from the point of view of the simple labour process the labourer stands in relation to the means of production not in their quality as capital but as the mere means and material of his own intelligent productive activity in tanning eg he deals with the skins as his simple object of labour it is not the capitalist whose skin he tans but it is different as soon as we deal with the process of production from the point of view of the process of creation of surplusvalue the means of production are at once changed into means for the absorption of the labour of others it is now no longer the labourer that employs the means of production but the means of production that employ the labourer instead of being consumed by him as material elements of his productive activity they consume him as the ferment necessary to their own lifeprocess and the lifeprocess of capital consists only in its movement as value constantly expanding constantly multiplying itself furnaces and workshops that stand idle by night and absorb no living labour are “a mere loss” to the capitalist hence furnaces and workshops constitute lawful claims upon the nightlabour of the workpeople the simple transformation of money into the material factors of the process of production into means of production transforms the latter into a title and a right to the labour and surplus labour of others an example will show in conclusion how this sophistication peculiar to and characteristic of capitalist production this complete inversion of the relation between dead and living labour between value and the force that creates value mirrors itself in the consciousness of capitalists during the revolt of the english factory lords between and “the head of one of the oldest and most respectable houses in the west of scotland messrs carlile sons co of the linen and cotton thread factory at paisley a company which has now existed for about a century which was in operation in and four generations of the same family have conducted it” this “very intelligent gentleman” then wrote a letter in the glasgow daily mail of april th with the title “the relay system” in which among other things the following grotesquely naïve passage occurs “let us now see what evils will attend the limiting to hours the working of the factory they amount to the most serious damage to the millowner’s prospects and property if he ie his “hands” worked hours before and is limited to then every machines or spindles in his establishment shrink to and should the works be disposed of they will be valued only as so that a sixth part would thus be deducted from the value of every factory in the country” to this west of scotland bourgeois brain inheriting the accumulated capitalistic qualities of “four generations” the value of the means of production spindles c is so inseparably mixed up with their property as capital to expand their own value and to swallow up daily a definite quantity of the unpaid labour of others that the head of the firm of carlile co actually imagines that if he sells his factory not only will the value of the spindles be paid to him but in addition their power of annexing surplusvalue not only the labour which is embodied in them and is necessary to the production of spindles of this kind but also the surplus labour which they help to pump out daily from the brave scots of paisley and for that very reason he thinks that with the shortening of the working day by hours the sellingprice of spinning machines dwindles to that of part production of relative surplusvalue chapter the concept of relative surplusvalue that portion of the working day which merely produces an equivalent for the value paid by the capitalist for his labourpower has up to this point been treated by us as a constant magnitude and such in fact it is under given conditions of production and at a given stage in the economic development of society beyond this his necessary labourtime the labourer we saw could continue to work for c hours the rate of surplusvalue and the length of the working day depended on the magnitude of this prolongation though the necessary labourtime was constant we saw on the other hand that the total working day was variable now suppose we have a working day whose length and whose apportionment between necessary labour and surplus labour are given let the whole line a c a–b–c represent for example a working day of hours the portion of a b hours of necessary labour and the portion b c hours of surplus labour how now can the production of surplusvalue be increased ie how can the surplus labour be prolonged without or independently of any prolongation of a c although the length of a c is given b c appears to be capable of prolongation if not by extension beyond its end c which is also the end of the working day a c yet at all events by pushing back its startingpoint b in the direction of a assume that b–b in the line abbc is equal to half of b c a–––b–b––c or to one hour’s labourtime if now in a c the working day of hours we move the point b to b b c becomes b c the surplus labour increases by one half from hours to hours although the working day remains as before at hours this extension of the surplus labourtime from b c to b c from hours to hours is however evidently impossible without a simultaneous contraction of the necessary labourtime from a b into a b from hours to hours the prolongation of the surplus labour would correspond to a shortening of the necessary labour or a portion of the labourtime previously consumed in reality for the labourer’s own benefit would be converted into labourtime for the benefit of the capitalist there would be an alteration not in the length of the working day but in its division into necessary labourtime and surplus labourtime on the other hand it is evident that the duration of the surplus labour is given when the length of the working day and the value of labourpower are given the value of labourpower ie the labourtime requisite to produce labourpower determines the labourtime necessary for the reproduction of that value if one workinghour be embodied in sixpence and the value of a day’s labourpower be five shillings the labourer must work hours a day in order to replace the value paid by capital for his labourpower or to produce an equivalent for the value of his daily necessary means of subsistence given the value of these means of subsistence the value of his labourpower is given and given the value of his labourpower the duration of his necessary labourtime is given the duration of the surplus labour however is arrived at by subtracting the necessary labourtime from the total working day ten hours subtracted from twelve leave two and it is not easy to see how under the given conditions the surplus labour can possibly be prolonged beyond two hours no doubt the capitalist can instead of five shillings pay the labourer four shillings and sixpence or even less for the reproduction of this value of four shillings and sixpence nine hours’ labourtime would suffice and consequently three hours of surplus labour instead of two would accrue to the capitalist and the surplusvalue would rise from one shilling to eighteenpence this result however would be obtained only by lowering the wages of the labourer below the value of his labourpower with the four shillings and sixpence which he produces in nine hours he commands onetenth less of the necessaries of life than before and consequently the proper reproduction of his labourpower is crippled the surplus labour would in this case be prolonged only by an overstepping of its normal limits its domain would be extended only by a usurpation of part of the domain of necessary labourtime despite the important part which this method plays in actual practice we are excluded from considering it in this place by our assumption that all commodities including labourpower are bought and sold at their full value granted this it follows that the labourtime necessary for the production of labourpower or for the reproduction of its value cannot be lessened by a fall in the labourer’s wages below the value of his labourpower but only by a fall in this value itself given the length of the working day the prolongation of the surplus labour must of necessity originate in the curtailment of the necessary labourtime the latter cannot arise from the former in the example we have taken it is necessary that the value of labourpower should actually fall by onetenth in order that the necessary labourtime may be diminished by onetenth ie from ten hours to nine and in order that the surplus labour may consequently be prolonged from two hours to three such a fall in the value of labourpower implies however that the same necessaries of life which were formerly produced in ten hours can now be produced in nine hours but this is impossible without an increase in the productiveness of labour for example suppose a shoemaker with given tools makes in one working day of twelve hours one pair of boots if he must make two pairs in the same time the productiveness of his labour must be doubled and this cannot be done except by an alteration in his tools or in his mode of working or in both hence the conditions of production ie his mode of production and the labourprocess itself must be revolutionised by increase in the productiveness of labour we mean generally an alteration in the labourprocess of such a kind as to shorten the labourtime socially necessary for the production of a commodity and to endow a given quantity of labour with the power of producing a greater quantity of usevalue hitherto in treating of surplusvalue arising from a simple prolongation of the working day we have assumed the mode of production to be given and invariable but when surplusvalue has to be produced by the conversion of necessary labour into surplus labour it by no means suffices for capital to take over the labourprocess in the form under which it has been historically handed down and then simply to prolong the duration of that process the technical and social conditions of the process and consequently the very mode of production must be revolutionised before the productiveness of labour can be increased by that means alone can the value of labourpower be made to sink and the portion of the working day necessary for the reproduction of that value be shortened the surplusvalue produced by prolongation of the working day i call absolute surplusvalue on the other hand the surplusvalue arising from the curtailment of the necessary labourtime and from the corresponding alteration in the respective lengths of the two components of the working day i call relative surplusvalue in order to effect a fall in the value of labourpower the increase in the productiveness of labour must seize upon those branches of industry whose products determine the value of labourpower and consequently either belong to the class of customary means of subsistence or are capable of supplying the place of those means but the value of a commodity is determined not only by the quantity of labour which the labourer directly bestows upon that commodity but also by the labour contained in the means of production for instance the value of a pair of boots depends not only on the cobbler’s labour but also on the value of the leather wax thread c hence a fall in the value of labourpower is also brought about by an increase in the productiveness of labour and by a corresponding cheapening of commodities in those industries which supply the instruments of labour and the raw material that form the material elements of the constant capital required for producing the necessaries of life but an increase in the productiveness of labour in those branches of industry which supply neither the necessaries of life nor the means of production for such necessaries leaves the value of labourpower undisturbed the cheapened commodity of course causes only a pro tanto fall in the value of labourpower a fall proportional to the extent of that commodity’s employment in the reproduction of labourpower shirts for instance are a necessary means of subsistence but are only one out of many the totality of the necessaries of life consists however of various commodities each the product of a distinct industry and the value of each of those commodities enters as a component part into the value of labourpower this latter value decreases with the decrease of the labourtime necessary for its reproduction the total decrease being the sum of all the different curtailments of labourtime effected in those various and distinct industries this general result is treated here as if it were the immediate result directly aimed at in each individual case whenever an individual capitalist cheapens shirts for instance by increasing the productiveness of labour he by no means necessarily aims at reducing the value of labourpower and shortening pro tanto the necessary labourtime but it is only in so far as he ultimately contributes to this result that he assists in raising the general rate of surplusvalue the general and necessary tendencies of capital must be distinguished from their forms of manifestation it is not our intention to consider here the way in which the laws immanent in capitalist production manifest themselves in the movements of individual masses of capital where they assert themselves as coercive laws of competition and are brought home to the mind and consciousness of the individual capitalist as the directing motives of his operations but this much is clear a scientific analysis of competition is not possible before we have a conception of the inner nature of capital just as the apparent motions of the heavenly bodies are not intelligible to any but him who is acquainted with their real motions motions which are not directly perceptible by the senses nevertheless for the better comprehension of the production of relative surplusvalue we may add the following remarks in which we assume nothing more than the results we have already obtained if one hour’s labour is embodied in sixpence a value of six shillings will be produced in a working day of hours suppose that with the prevailing productiveness of labour articles are produced in these hours let the value of the means of production used up in each article be sixpence under these circumstances each article costs one shilling sixpence for the value of the means of production and sixpence for the value newly added in working with those means now let some one capitalist contrive to double the productiveness of labour and to produce in the working day of hours instead of such articles the value of the means of production remaining the same the value of each article will fall to ninepence made up of sixpence for the value of the means of production and threepence for the value newly added by the labour despite the doubled productiveness of labour the day’s labour creates as before a new value of six shillings and no more which however is now spread over twice as many articles of this value each article now has embodied in it th instead of th threepence instead of sixpence or what amounts to the same thing only half an hour’s instead of a whole hour’s labourtime is now added to the means of production while they are being transformed into each article the individual value of these articles is now below their social value in other words they have cost less labourtime than the great bulk of the same article produced under the average social conditions each article costs on an average one shilling and represents hours of social labour but under the altered mode of production it costs only ninepence or contains only ½ hours’ labour the real value of a commodity is however not its individual value but its social value that is to say the real value is not measured by the labourtime that the article in each individual case costs the producer but by the labourtime socially required for its production if therefore the capitalist who applies the new method sells his commodity at its social value of one shilling he sells it for threepence above its individual value and thus realises an extra surplusvalue of threepence on the other hand the working day of hours is as regards him now represented by articles instead of hence in order to get rid of the product of one working day the demand must be double what it was ie the market must become twice as extensive other things being equal his commodities can command a more extended market only by a diminution of their prices he will therefore sell them above their individual but under their social value say at tenpence each by this means he still squeezes an extra surplusvalue of one penny out of each this augmentation of surplusvalue is pocketed by him whether his commodities belong or not to the class of necessary means of subsistence that participate in determining the general value of labourpower hence independently of this latter circumstance there is a motive for each individual capitalist to cheapen his commodities by increasing the productiveness of labour nevertheless even in this case the increased production of surplusvalue arises from the curtailment of the necessary labourtime and from the corresponding prolongation of the surplus labour let the necessary labourtime amount to hours the value of a day’s labourpower to five shillings the surplus labourtime to hours and the daily surplusvalue to one shilling but the capitalist now produces articles which he sells at tenpence apiece making twenty shillings in all since the value of the means of production is twelve shillings of these articles merely replace the constant capital advanced the labour of the hours’ working day is represented by the remaining articles since the price of the labourpower is five shillings articles represent the necessary labourtime and articles the surplus labour the ratio of the necessary labour to the surplus labour which under average social conditions was is now only the same result may be arrived at in the following way the value of the product of the working day of hours is twenty shillings of this sum twelve shillings belong to the value of the means of production a value that merely reappears there remain eight shillings which are the expression in money of the value newly created during the working day this sum is greater than the sum in which average social labour of the same kind is expressed twelve hours of the latter labour are expressed by six shillings only the exceptionally productive labour operates as intensified labour it creates in equal periods of time greater values than average social labour of the same kind see ch i sect p but our capitalist still continues to pay as before only five shillings as the value of a day’s labourpower hence instead of hours the labourer need now work only ½ hours in order to reproduce this value his surplus labour is therefore increased by ½ hours and the surplusvalue he produces grows from one into three shillings hence the capitalist who applies the improved method of production appropriates to surplus labour a greater portion of the working day than the other capitalists in the same trade he does individually what the whole body of capitalists engaged in producing relative surplusvalue do collectively on the other hand however this extra surplusvalue vanishes so soon as the new method of production has become general and has consequently caused the difference between the individual value of the cheapened commodity and its social value to vanish the law of the determination of value by labourtime a law which brings under its sway the individual capitalist who applies the new method of production by compelling him to sell his goods under their social value this same law acting as a coercive law of competition forces his competitors to adopt the new method the general rate of surplusvalue is therefore ultimately affected by the whole process only when the increase in the productiveness of labour has seized upon those branches of production that are connected with and has cheapened those commodities that form part of the necessary means of subsistence and are therefore elements of the value of labourpower the value of commodities is in inverse ratio to the productiveness of labour and so too is the value of labourpower because it depends on the values of commodities relative surplusvalue is on the contrary directly proportional to that productiveness it rises with rising and falls with falling productiveness the value of money being assumed to be constant an average social working day of hours always produces the same new value six shillings no matter how this sum may be apportioned between surplusvalue and wages but if in consequence of increased productiveness the value of the necessaries of life fall and the value of a day’s labourpower be thereby reduced from five shillings to three the surplusvalue increases from one shilling to three ten hours were necessary for the reproduction of the value of the labourpower now only six are required four hours have been set free and can be annexed to the domain of surplus labour hence there is immanent in capital an inclination and constant tendency to heighten the productiveness of labour in order to cheapen commodities and by such cheapening to cheapen the labourer himself the value of a commodity is in itself of no interest to the capitalist what alone interests him is the surplusvalue that dwells in it and is realisable by sale realisation of the surplusvalue necessarily carries with it the refunding of the value that was advanced now since relative surplusvalue increases in direct proportion to the development of the productiveness of labour while on the other hand the value of commodities diminishes in the same proportion since one and the same process cheapens commodities and augments the surplusvalue contained in them we have here the solution of the riddle why does the capitalist whose sole concern is the production of exchangevalue continually strive to depress the exchangevalue of commodities a riddle with which quesnay one of the founders of political economy tormented his opponents and to which they could give him no answer “you acknowledge” he says “that the more expenses and the cost of labour can in the manufacture of industrial products be reduced without injury to production the more advantageous is such reduction because it diminishes the price of the finished article and yet you believe that the production of wealth which arises from the labour of the workpeople consists in the augmentation of the exchangevalue of their products” the shortening of the working day is therefore by no means what is aimed at in capitalist production when labour is economised by increasing its productiveness it is only the shortening of the labourtime necessary for the production of a definite quantity of commodities that is aimed at the fact that the workman when the productiveness of his labour has been increased produces say times as many commodities as before and thus spends onetenth as much labourtime on each by no means prevents him from continuing to work hours as before nor from producing in those hours articles instead of nay more his working day may be prolonged at the same time so as to make him produce say articles in hours in the treatises therefore of economists of the stamp of macculloch ure senior and tutti quanti the like we may read upon one page that the labourer owes a debt of gratitude to capital for developing his productiveness because the necessary labourtime is thereby shortened and on the next page that he must prove his gratitude by working in future for hours instead of the object of all development of the productiveness of labour within the limits of capitalist production is to shorten that part of the working day during which the workman must labour for his own benefit and by that very shortening to lengthen the other part of the day during which he is at liberty to work gratis for the capitalist how far this result is also attainable without cheapening commodities will appear from an examination of the particular modes of producing relative surplusvalue to which examination we now proceed chapter cooperation capitalist production only then really begins as we have already seen when each individual capital employs simultaneously a comparatively large number of labourers when consequently the labourprocess is carried on on an extensive scale and yields relatively large quantities of products a greater number of labourers working together at the same time in one place or if you will in the same field of labour in order to produce the same sort of commodity under the mastership of one capitalist constitutes both historically and logically the startingpoint of capitalist production with regard to the mode of production itself manufacture in its strict meaning is hardly to be distinguished in its earliest stages from the handicraft trades of the guilds otherwise than by the greater number of workmen simultaneously employed by one and the same individual capital the workshop of the medieval master handicraftsman is simply enlarged at first therefore the difference is purely quantitative we have shown that the surplusvalue produced by a given capital is equal to the surplusvalue produced by each workman multiplied by the number of workmen simultaneously employed the number of workmen in itself does nor affect either the rate of surplusvalue or the degree of exploitation of labourpower if a working day of hours be embodied in six shillings such days will be embodied in times shillings in one case × workinghours and in the other such hours are incorporated in the product in the production of value a number of workmen rank merely as so many individual workmen and it therefore makes no difference in the value produced whether the men work separately or united under the control of one capitalist nevertheless within certain limits a modification takes place the labour realised in value is labour of an average social quality is consequently the expenditure of average labourpower any average magnitude however is merely the average of a number of separate magnitudes all of one kind but differing as to quantity in every industry each individual labourer be he peter or paul differs from the average labourer these individual differences or “errors” as they are called in mathematics compensate one another and vanish whenever a certain minimum number of workmen are employed together the celebrated sophist and sycophant edmund burke goes so far as to make the following assertion based on his practical observations as a farmer viz that “in so small a platoon” as that of five farm labourers all individual differences in the labour vanish and that consequently any given five adult farm labourers taken together will in the same time do as much work as any other five but however that may be it is clear that the collective working day of a large number of workmen simultaneously employed divided by the number of these workmen gives one day of average social labour for example let the working day of each individual be hours then the collective working day of men simultaneously employed consists of hours and although the labour of each of the dozen men may deviate more or less from average social labour each of them requiring a different time for the same operation yet since the working day of each is onetwelfth of the collective working day of hours it possesses the qualities of an average social working day from the point of view however of the capitalist who employs these men the working day is that of the whole dozen each individual man’s day is an aliquot part of the collective working day no matter whether the men assist one another in their work or whether the connexion between their operations consists merely in the fact that the men are all working for the same capitalist but if the men are employed in six pairs by as many different small masters it will be quite a matter of chance whether each of these masters produces the same value and consequently whether he realises the general rate of surplusvalue deviations would occur in individual cases if one workman required considerably more time for the production of a commodity than is socially necessary the duration of the necessary labourtime would in his case sensibly deviate from the labourtime socially necessary on an average and consequently his labour would not count as average labour nor his labourpower as average labourpower it would either be not saleable at all or only at something below the average value of labourpower a fixed minimum of efficiency in all labour is therefore assumed and we shall see later on that capitalist production provides the means of fixing this minimum nevertheless this minimum deviates from the average although on the other hand the capitalist has to pay the average value of labourpower of the six small masters one would therefore squeeze out more than the average rate of surplusvalue another less the inequalities would be compensated for the society at large but not for the individual masters thus the laws of the production of value are only fully realised for the individual producer when he produces as a capitalist and employs a number of workmen together whose labour by its collective nature is at once stamped as average social labour even without an alteration in the system of working the simultaneous employment of a large number of labourers effects a revolution in the material conditions of the labourprocess the buildings in which they work the storehouses for the raw material the implements and utensils used simultaneously or in turns by the workmen in short a portion of the means of production are now consumed in common on the one hand the exchangevalue of these means of production is not increased for the exchangevalue of a commodity is not raised by its usevalue being consumed more thoroughly and to greater advantage on the other hand they are used in common and therefore on a larger scale than before a room where twenty weavers work at twenty looms must be larger than the room of a single weaver with two assistants but it costs less labour to build one workshop for twenty persons than to build ten to accommodate two weavers each thus the value of the means of production that are concentrated for use in common on a large scale does not increase in direct proportion to the expansion and to the increased useful effect of those means when consumed in common they give up a smaller part of their value to each single product partly because the total value they part with is spread over a greater quantity of products and partly because their value though absolutely greater is having regard to their sphere of action in the process relatively less than the value of isolated means of production owing to this the value of a part of the constant capital falls and in proportion to the magnitude of the fall the total value of the commodity also falls the effect is the same as if the means of production had cost less the economy in their application is entirely owing to their being consumed in common by a large number of workmen moreover this character of being necessary conditions of social labour a character that distinguishes them from the dispersed and relatively more costly means of production of isolated independent labourers or small masters is acquired even when the numerous workmen assembled together do not assist one another but merely work side by side a portion of the instruments of labour acquires this social character before the labourprocess itself does so economy in the use of the means of production has to be considered under two aspects first as cheapening commodities and thereby bringing about a fall in the value of labourpower secondly as altering the ratio of the surplusvalue to the total capital advanced ie to the sum of the values of the constant and variable capital the latter aspect will not be considered until we come to the third book to which with the object of treating them in their proper connexion we also relegate many other points that relate to the present question the march of our analysis compels this splitting up of the subjectmatter a splitting up that is quite in keeping with the spirit of capitalist production for since in this mode of production the workman finds the instruments of labour existing independently of him as another man’s property economy in their use appears with regard to him to be a distinct operation one that does not concern him and which therefore has no connexion with the methods by which his own personal productiveness is increased when numerous labourers work together side by side whether in one and the same process or in different but connected processes they are said to cooperate or to work in cooperation just as the offensive power of a squadron of cavalry or the defensive power of a regiment of infantry is essentially different from the sum of the offensive or defensive powers of the individual cavalry or infantry soldiers taken separately so the sum total of the mechanical forces exerted by isolated workmen differs from the social force that is developed when many hands take part simultaneously in one and the same undivided operation such as raising a heavy weight turning a winch or removing an obstacle in such cases the effect of the combined labour could either not be produced at all by isolated individual labour or it could only be produced by a great expenditure of time or on a very dwarfed scale not only have we here an increase in the productive power of the individual by means of cooperation but the creation of a new power namely the collective power of masses apart from the new power that arises from the fusion of many forces into one single force mere social contact begets in most industries an emulation and a stimulation of the animal spirits that heighten the efficiency of each individual workman hence it is that a dozen persons working together will in their collective working day of hours produce far more than twelve isolated men each working hours or than one man who works twelve days in succession the reason of this is that man is if not as aristotle contends a political at all events a social animal although a number of men may be occupied together at the same time on the same or the same kind of work yet the labour of each as a part of the collective labour may correspond to a distinct phase of the labourprocess through all whose phases in consequence of cooperation the subject of their labour passes with greater speed for instance if a dozen masons place themselves in a row so as to pass stones from the foot of a ladder to its summit each of them does the same thing nevertheless their separate acts form connected parts of one total operation they are particular phases which must be gone through by each stone and the stones are thus carried up quicker by the hands of the row of men than they could be if each man went separately up and down the ladder with his burden the object is carried over the same distance in a shorter time again a combination of labour occurs whenever a building for instance is taken in hand on different sides simultaneously although here also the cooperating masons are doing the same or the same kind of work the masons in their collective working day of hours make much more progress with the building than one mason could make working for days or hours the reason is that a body of men working in concert has hands and eyes both before and behind and is to a certain degree omnipresent the various parts of the work progress simultaneously in the above instances we have laid stress upon the point that the men do the same or the same kind of work because this the most simple form of labour in common plays a great part in cooperation even in its most fully developed stage if the work be complicated then the mere number of the men who cooperate allows of the various operations being apportioned to different hands and consequently of being carried on simultaneously the time necessary for the completion of the whole work is thereby shortened in many industries there are critical periods determined by the nature of the process during which certain definite results must be obtained for instance if a flock of sheep has to be shorn or a field of wheat to be cut and harvested the quantity and quality of the product depends on the work being begun and ended within a certain time in these cases the time that ought to be taken by the process is prescribed just as it is in herring fishing a single person cannot carve a working day of more than say hours out of the natural day but men cooperating extend the working day to hours the shortness of the time allowed for the work is compensated for by the large mass of labour thrown upon the field of production at the decisive moment the completion of the task within the proper time depends on the simultaneous application of numerous combined working days the amount of useful effect depends on the number of labourers this number however is always smaller than the number of isolated labourers required to do the same amount of work in the same period it is owing to the absence of this kind of cooperation that in the western part of the united states quantities of corn and in those parts of east india where english rule has destroyed the old communities quantities of cotton are yearly wasted on the one hand cooperation allows of the work being carried on over an extended space it is consequently imperatively called for in certain undertakings such as draining constructing dykes irrigation works and the making of canals roads and railways on the other hand while extending the scale of production it renders possible a relative contraction of the arena this contraction of arena simultaneous with and arising from extension of scale whereby a number of useless expenses are cut down is owing to the conglomeration of labourers to the aggregation of various processes and to the concentration of the means of production the combined working day produces relatively to an equal sum of isolated working days a greater quantity of usevalues and consequently diminishes the labourtime necessary for the production of a given useful effect whether the combined working day in a given case acquires this increased productive power because it heightens the mechanical force of labour or extends its sphere of action over a greater space or contracts the field of production relatively to the scale of production or at the critical moment sets large masses of labour to work or excites emulation between individuals and raises their animal spirits or impresses on the similar operations carried on by a number of men the stamp of continuity and manysidedness or performs simultaneously different operations or economises the means of production by use in common or lends to individual labour the character of average social labour whichever of these be the cause of the increase the special productive power of the combined working day is under all circumstances the social productive power of labour or the productive power of social labour this power is due to cooperation itself when the labourer cooperates systematically with others he strips off the fetters of his individuality and develops the capabilities of his species as a general rule labourers cannot cooperate without being brought together their assemblage in one place is a necessary condition of their cooperation hence wagelabourers cannot cooperate unless they are employed simultaneously by the same capital the same capitalist and unless therefore their labourpowers are bought simultaneously by him the total value of these labourpowers or the amount of the wages of these labourers for a day or a week as the case may be must be ready in the pocket of the capitalist before the workmen are assembled for the process of production the payment of workmen at once though only for one day requires a greater outlay of capital than does the payment of a smaller number of men week by week during a whole year hence the number of the labourers that cooperate or the scale of cooperation depends in the first instance on the amount of capital that the individual capitalist can spare for the purchase of labourpower in other words on the extent to which a single capitalist has command over the means of subsistence of a number of labourers and as with the variable so it is with the constant capital for example the outlay on raw material is times as great for the capitalist who employs men as it is for each of the capitalists who employ men the value and quantity of the instruments of labour used in common do not it is true increase at the same rate as the number of workmen but they do increase very considerably hence concentration of large masses of the means of production in the hands of individual capitalists is a material condition for the cooperation of wagelabourers and the extent of the cooperation or the scale of production depends on the extent of this concentration we saw in a former chapter that a certain minimum amount of capital was necessary in order that the number of labourers simultaneously employed and consequently the amount of surplusvalue produced might suffice to liberate the employer himself from manual labour to convert him from a small master into a capitalist and thus formally to establish capitalist production we now see that a certain minimum amount is a necessary condition for the conversion of numerous isolated and independent processes into one combined social process we also saw that at first the subjection of labour to capital was only a formal result of the fact that the labourer instead of working for himself works for and consequently under the capitalist by the cooperation of numerous wagelabourers the sway of capital develops into a requisite for carrying on the labourprocess itself into a real requisite of production that a capitalist should command on the field of production is now as indispensable as that a general should command on the field of battle all combined labour on a large scale requires more or less a directing authority in order to secure the harmonious working of the individual activities and to perform the general functions that have their origin in the action of the combined organism as distinguished from the action of its separate organs a single violin player is his own conductor an orchestra requires a separate one the work of directing superintending and adjusting becomes one of the functions of capital from the moment that the labour under the control of capital becomes cooperative once a function of capital it acquires special characteristics the directing motive the end and aim of capitalist production is to extract the greatest possible amount of surplusvalue and consequently to exploit labourpower to the greatest possible extent as the number of the cooperating labourers increases so too does their resistance to the domination of capital and with it the necessity for capital to overcome this resistance by counterpressure the control exercised by the capitalist is not only a special function due to the nature of the social labourprocess and peculiar to that process but it is at the same time a function of the exploitation of a social labourprocess and is consequently rooted in the unavoidable antagonism between the exploiter and the living and labouring raw material he exploits again in proportion to the increasing mass of the means of production now no longer the property of the labourer but of the capitalist the necessity increases for some effective control over the proper application of those means moreover the cooperation of wage labourers is entirely brought about by the capital that employs them their union into one single productive body and the establishment of a connexion between their individual functions are matters foreign and external to them are not their own act but the act of the capital that brings and keeps them together hence the connexion existing between their various labours appears to them ideally in the shape of a preconceived plan of the capitalist and practically in the shape of the authority of the same capitalist in the shape of the powerful will of another who subjects their activity to his aims if then the control of the capitalist is in substance twofold by reason of the twofold nature of the process of production itself which on the one hand is a social process for producing usevalues on the other a process for creating surplusvalue in form that control is despotic as cooperation extends its scale this despotism takes forms peculiar to itself just as at first the capitalist is relieved from actual labour so soon as his capital has reached that minimum amount with which capitalist production as such begins so now he hands over the work of direct and constant supervision of the individual workmen and groups of workmen to a special kind of wagelabourer an industrial army of workmen under the command of a capitalist requires like a real army officers managers and sergeants foremen overlookers who while the work is being done command in the name of the capitalist the work of supervision becomes their established and exclusive function when comparing the mode of production of isolated peasants and artisans with production by slavelabour the political economist counts this labour of superintendence among the faux frais of production but when considering the capitalist mode of production he on the contrary treats the work of control made necessary by the cooperative character of the labourprocess as identical with the different work of control necessitated by the capitalist character of that process and the antagonism of interests between capitalist and labourer it is not because he is a leader of industry that a man is a capitalist on the contrary he is a leader of industry because he is a capitalist the leadership of industry is an attribute of capital just as in feudal times the functions of general and judge were attributes of landed property the labourer is the owner of his labourpower until he has done bargaining for its sale with the capitalist and he can sell no more than what he has ie his individual isolated labourpower this state of things is in no way altered by the fact that the capitalist instead of buying the labourpower of one man buys that of and enters into separate contracts with unconnected men instead of with one he is at liberty to set the men to work without letting them cooperate he pays them the value of independent labourpowers but he does not pay for the combined labourpower of the hundred being independent of each other the labourers are isolated persons who enter into relations with the capitalist but not with one another this cooperation begins only with the labourprocess but they have then ceased to belong to themselves on entering that process they become incorporated with capital as cooperators as members of a working organism they are but special modes of existence of capital hence the productive power developed by the labourer when working in cooperation is the productive power of capital this power is developed gratuitously whenever the workmen are placed under given conditions and it is capital that places them under such conditions because this power costs capital nothing and because on the other hand the labourer himself does not develop it before his labour belongs to capital it appears as a power with which capital is endowed by nature a productive power that is immanent in capital the colossal effects of simple cooperation are to be seen in the gigantic structures of the ancient asiatics egyptians etruscans c “it has happened in times past that these oriental states after supplying the expenses of their civil and military establishments have found themselves in possession of a surplus which they could apply to works of magnificence or utility and in the construction of these their command over the hands and arms of almost the entire nonagricultural population has produced stupendous monuments which still indicate their power the teeming valley of the nile produced food for a swarming nonagricultural population and this food belonging to the monarch and the priesthood afforded the means of erecting the mighty monuments which filled the land in moving the colossal statues and vast masses of which the transport creates wonder human labour almost alone was prodigally used the number of the labourers and the concentration of their efforts sufficed we see mighty coral reefs rising from the depths of the ocean into islands and firm land yet each individual depositor is puny weak and contemptible the nonagricultural labourers of an asiatic monarchy have little but their individual bodily exertions to bring to the task but their number is their strength and the power of directing these masses gave rise to the palaces and temples the pyramids and the armies of gigantic statues of which the remains astonish and perplex us it is that confinement of the revenues which feed them to one or a few hands which makes such undertakings possible” this power of asiatic and egyptian kings etruscan theocrats c has in modern society been transferred to the capitalist whether he be an isolated or as in jointstock companies a collective capitalist cooperation such as we find it at the dawn of human development among races who live by the chase or say in the agriculture of indian communities is based on the one hand on ownership in common of the means of production and on the other hand on the fact that in those cases each individual has no more torn himself off from the navelstring of his tribe or community than each bee has freed itself from connexion with the hive such cooperation is distinguished from capitalistic cooperation by both of the above characteristics the sporadic application of cooperation on a large scale in ancient times in the middle ages and in modern colonies reposes on relations of dominion and servitude principally on slavery the capitalistic form on the contrary presupposes from first to last the free wagelabourer who sells his labourpower to capital historically however this form is developed in opposition to peasant agriculture and to the carrying on of independent handicrafts whether in guilds or not from the standpoint of these capitalistic cooperation does not manifest itself as a particular historical form of cooperation but cooperation itself appears to be a historical form peculiar to and specifically distinguishing the capitalist process of production just as the social productive power of labour that is developed by cooperation appears to be the productive power of capital so cooperation itself contrasted with the process of production carried on by isolated independent labourers or even by small employers appears to be a specific form of the capitalist process of production it is the first change experienced by the actual labourprocess when subjected to capital this change takes place spontaneously the simultaneous employment of a large number of wagelabourers in one and the same process which is a necessary condition of this change also forms the startingpoint of capitalist production this point coincides with the birth of capital itself if then on the one hand the capitalist mode of production presents itself to us historically as a necessary condition to the transformation of the labourprocess into a social process so on the other hand this social form of the labourprocess presents itself as a method employed by capital for the more profitable exploitation of labour by increasing that labour’s productiveness in the elementary form under which we have hitherto viewed it cooperation is a necessary concomitant of all production on a large scale but it does not in itself represent a fixed form characteristic of a particular epoch in the development of the capitalist mode of production at the most it appears to do so and that only approximately in the handicraftlike beginnings of manufacture and in that kind of agriculture on a large scale which corresponds to the epoch of manufacture and is distinguished from peasant agriculture mainly by the number of the labourers simultaneously employed and by the mass of the means of production concentrated for their use simple cooperation is always the prevailing form in those branches of production in which capital operates on a large scale and division of labour and machinery play but a subordinate part cooperation ever constitutes the fundamental form of the capitalist mode of production nevertheless the elementary form of cooperation continues to subsist as a particular form of capitalist production side by side with the more developed forms of that mode of production chapter division of labour and manufacture section twofold origin of manufacture that cooperation which is based on division of labour assumes its typical form in manufacture and is the prevalent characteristic form of the capitalist process of production throughout the manufacturing period properly so called that period roughly speaking extends from the middle of the th to the last third of the th century manufacture takes its rise in two ways by the assemblage in one workshop under the control of a single capitalist of labourers belonging to various independent handicrafts but through whose hands a given article must pass on its way to completion a carriage for example was formerly the product of the labour of a great number of independent artificers such as wheelwrights harnessmakers tailors locksmiths upholsterers turners fringemakers glaziers painters polishers gilders c in the manufacture of carriages however all these different artificers are assembled in one building where they work into one another’s hands it is true that a carriage cannot be gilt before it has been made but if a number of carriages are being made simultaneously some may be in the hands of the gilders while others are going through an earlier process so far we are still in the domain of simple cooperation which finds its materials ready to hand in the shape of men and things but very soon an important change takes place the tailor the locksmith and the other artificers being now exclusively occupied in carriagemaking each gradually loses through want of practice the ability to carry on to its full extent his old handicraft but on the other hand his activity now confined in one groove assumes the form best adapted to the narrowed sphere of action at first carriage manufacture is a combination of various independent handicrafts by degrees it becomes the splitting up of carriagemaking into its various detail processes each of which crystallises into the exclusive function of a particular workman the manufacture as a whole being carried on by the men in conjunction in the same way cloth manufacture as also a whole series of other manufactures arose by combining different handicrafts together under the control of a single capitalist manufacture also arises in a way exactly the reverse of this namely by one capitalist employing simultaneously in one workshop a number of artificers who all do the same or the same kind of work such as making paper type or needles this is cooperation in its most elementary form each of these artificers with the help perhaps of one or two apprentices makes the entire commodity and he consequently performs in succession all the operations necessary for its production he still works in his old handicraftlike way but very soon external circumstances cause a different use to be made of the concentration of the workmen on one spot and of the simultaneousness of their work an increased quantity of the article has perhaps to be delivered within a given time the work is therefore redistributed instead of each man being allowed to perform all the various operations in succession these operations are changed into disconnected isolated ones carried on side by side each is assigned to a different artificer and the whole of them together are performed simultaneously by the cooperating workmen this accidental repartition gets repeated develops advantages of its own and gradually ossifies into a systematic division of labour the commodity from being the individual product of an independent artificer becomes the social product of a union of artificers each of whom performs one and only one of the constituent partial operations the same operations which in the case of a papermaker belonging to a german guild merged one into the other as the successive acts of one artificer became in the dutch paper manufacture so many partial operations carried on side by side by numerous cooperating labourers the needlemaker of the nuremberg guild was the cornerstone on which the english needle manufacture was raised but while in nuremberg that single artificer performed a series of perhaps operations one after another in england it was not long before there were needlemakers side by side each performing one alone of those operations and in consequence of further experience each of those operations was again split up isolated and made the exclusive function of a separate workman the mode in which manufacture arises its growth out of handicrafts is therefore twofold on the one hand it arises from the union of various independent handicrafts which become stripped of their independence and specialised to such an extent as to be reduced to mere supplementary partial processes in the production of one particular commodity on the other hand it arises from the cooperation of artificers of one handicraft it splits up that particular handicraft into its various detail operations isolating and making these operations independent of one another up to the point where each becomes the exclusive function of a particular labourer on the one hand therefore manufacture either introduces division of labour into a process of production or further develops that division on the other hand it unites together handicrafts that were formerly separate but whatever may have been its particular startingpoint its final form is invariably the same a productive mechanism whose parts are human beings for a proper understanding of the division of labour in manufacture it is essential that the following points be firmly grasped first the decomposition of a process of production into its various successive steps coincides here strictly with the resolution of a handicraft into its successive manual operations whether complex or simple each operation has to be done by hand retains the character of a handicraft and is therefore dependent on the strength skill quickness and sureness of the individual workman in handling his tools the handicraft continues to be the basis this narrow technical basis excludes a really scientific analysis of any definite process of industrial production since it is still a condition that each detail process gone through by the product must be capable of being done by hand and of forming in its way a separate handicraft it is just because handicraft skill continues in this way to be the foundation of the process of production that each workman becomes exclusively assigned to a partial function and that for the rest of his life his labourpower is turned into the organ of this detail function secondly this division of labour is a particular sort of cooperation and many of its disadvantages spring from the general character of cooperation and not from this particular form of it section the detail labourer and his implements if we now go more into detail it is in the first place clear that a labourer who all his life performs one and the same simple operation converts his whole body into the automatic specialised implement of that operation consequently he takes less time in doing it than the artificer who performs a whole series of operations in succession but the collective labourer who constitutes the living mechanism of manufacture is made up solely of such specialised detail labourers hence in comparison with the independent handicraft more is produced in a given time or the productive power of labour is increased moreover when once this fractional work is established as the exclusive function of one person the methods it employs become perfected the workman’s continued repetition of the same simple act and the concentration of his attention on it teach him by experience how to attain the desired effect with the minimum of exertion but since there are always several generations of labourers living at one time and working together at the manufacture of a given article the technical skill the tricks of the trade thus acquired become established and are accumulated and handed down manufacture in fact produces the skill of the detail labourer by reproducing and systematically driving to an extreme within the workshop the naturally developed differentiation of trades which it found ready to hand in society at large on the other hand the conversion of fractional work into the lifecalling of one man corresponds to the tendency shown by earlier societies to make trades hereditary either to petrify them into castes or whenever definite historical conditions beget in the individual a tendency to vary in a manner incompatible with the nature of castes to ossify them into guilds castes and guilds arise from the action of the same natural law that regulates the differentiation of plants and animals into species and varieties except that when a certain degree of development has been reached the heredity of castes and the exclusiveness of guilds are ordained as a law of society “the muslins of dakka in fineness the calicoes and other piece goods of coromandel in brilliant and durable colours have never been surpassed yet they are produced without capital machinery division of labour or any of those means which give such facilities to the manufacturing interest of europe the weaver is merely a detached individual working a web when ordered of a customer and with a loom of the rudest construction consisting sometimes of a few branches or bars of wood put roughly together there is even no expedient for rolling up the warp the loom must therefore be kept stretched to its full length and becomes so inconveniently large that it cannot be contained within the hut of the manufacturer who is therefore compelled to ply his trade in the open air where it is interrupted by every vicissitude of the weather” it is only the special skill accumulated from generation to generation and transmitted from father to son that gives to the hindu as it does to the spider this proficiency and yet the work of such a hindu weaver is very complicated compared with that of a manufacturing labourer an artificer who performs one after another the various fractional operations in the production of a finished article must at one time change his place at another his tools the transition from one operation to another interrupts the flow of his labour and creates so to say gaps in his working day these gaps close up so soon as he is tied to one and the same operation all day long they vanish in proportion as the changes in his work diminish the resulting increased productive power is owing either to an increased expenditure of labourpower in a given time ie to increased intensity of labour or to a decrease in the amount of labourpower unproductively consumed the extra expenditure of power demanded by every transition from rest to motion is made up for by prolonging the duration of the normal velocity when once acquired on the other hand constant labour of one uniform kind disturbs the intensity and flow of a man’s animal spirits which find recreation and delight in mere change of activity the productiveness of labour depends not only on the proficiency of the workman but on the perfection of his tools tools of the same kind such as knives drills gimlets hammers c may be employed in different processes and the same tool may serve various purposes in a single process but so soon as the different operations of a labourprocess are disconnected the one from the other and each fractional operation acquires in the hands of the detail labourer a suitable and peculiar form alterations become necessary in the implements that previously served more than one purpose the direction taken by this change is determined by the difficulties experienced in consequence of the unchanged form of the implement manufacture is characterised by the differentiation of the instruments of labour a differentiation whereby implements of a given sort acquire fixed shapes adapted to each particular application and by the specialisation of those instruments giving to each special implement its full play only in the hands of a specific detail labourer in birmingham alone varieties of hammers are produced and not only is each adapted to one particular process but several varieties often serve exclusively for the different operations in one and the same process the manufacturing period simplifies improves and multiplies the implements of labour by adapting them to the exclusively special functions of each detail labourer it thus creates at the same time one of the material conditions for the existence of machinery which consists of a combination of simple instruments the detail labourer and his implements are the simplest elements of manufacture let us now turn to its aspect as a whole section the two fundamental forms of manufacture heterogeneous manufacture serial manufacture the organisation of manufacture has two fundamental forms which in spite of occasional blending are essentially different in kind and moreover play very distinct parts in the subsequent transformation of manufacture into modern industry carried on by machinery this double character arises from the nature of the article produced this article either results from the mere mechanical fitting together of partial products made independently or owes its completed shape to a series of connected processes and manipulations a locomotive for instance consists of more than independent parts it cannot however serve as an example of the first kind of genuine manufacture for it is a structure produced by modern mechanical industry but a watch can and william petty used it to illustrate the division of labour in manufacture formerly the individual work of a nuremberg artificer the watch has been transformed into the social product of an immense number of detail labourers such as mainspring makers dial makers spiral spring makers jewelled hole makers ruby lever makers hand makers case makers screw makers gilders with numerous subdivisions such as wheel makers brass and steel separate pin makers movement makers acheveur de pignon fixes the wheels on the axles polishes the facets c pivot makers planteur de finissage puts the wheels and springs in the works finisseur de barillet cuts teeth in the wheels makes the holes of the right size c escapement makers cylinder makers for cylinder escapements escapement wheel makers balance wheel makers raquette makers apparatus for regulating the watch the planteur d’échappement escapement maker proper then the repasseur de barillet finishes the box for the spring c steel polishers wheel polishers screw polishers figure painters dial enamellers melt the enamel on the copper fabricant de pendants makes the ring by which the case is hung finisseur de charnière puts the brass hinge in the cover c faiseur de secret puts in the springs that open the case graveur ciseleur polisseur de boîte c c and last of all the repasseur who fits together the whole watch and hands it over in a going state only a few parts of the watch pass through several hands and all these membra disjecta come together for the first time in the hand that binds them into one mechanical whole this external relation between the finished product and its various and diverse elements makes it as well in this case as in the case of all similar finished articles a matter of chance whether the detail labourers are brought together in one workshop or not the detail operations may further be carried on like so many independent handicrafts as they are in the cantons of vaud and neufchâtel while in geneva there exist large watch manufactories where the detail labourers directly cooperate under the control of a single capitalist and even in the latter case the dial the springs and the case are seldom made in the factory itself to carry on the trade as a manufacture with concentration of workmen is in the watch trade profitable only under exceptional conditions because competition is greater between the labourers who desire to work at home and because the splitting up of the work into a number of heterogeneous processes permits but little use of the instruments of labour in common and the capitalist by scattering the work saves the outlay on workshops c nevertheless the position of this detail labourer who though he works at home does so for a capitalist manufacturer établisseur is very different from that of the independent artificer who works for his own customers the second kind of manufacture its perfected form produces articles that go through connected phases of development through a series of processes step by step like the wire in the manufacture of needles which passes through the hands of and sometimes even different detail workmen in so far as such a manufacture when first started combines scattered handicrafts it lessens the space by which the various phases of production are separated from each other the time taken in passing from one stage to another is shortened so is the labour that effectuates this passage in comparison with a handicraft productive power is gained and this gain is owing to the general cooperative character of manufacture on the other hand division of labour which is the distinguishing principle of manufacture requires the isolation of the various stages of production and their independence of each other the establishment and maintenance of a connexion between the isolated functions necessitates the incessant transport of the article from one hand to another and from one process to another from the standpoint of modern mechanical industry this necessity stands forth as a characteristic and costly disadvantage and one that is immanent in the principle of manufacture if we confine our attention to some particular lot of raw materials of rags for instance in paper manufacture or of wire in needle manufacture we perceive that it passes in succession through a series of stages in the hands of the various detail workmen until completion on the other hand if we look at the workshop as a whole we see the raw material in all the stages of its production at the same time the collective labourer with one set of his many hands armed with one kind of tools draws the wire with another set armed with different tools he at the same time straightens it with another he cuts it with another points it and so on the different detail processes which were successive in time have become simultaneous go on side by side in space hence production of a greater quantum of finished commodities in a given time this simultaneity it is true is due to the general cooperative form of the process as a whole but manufacture not only finds the conditions for cooperation ready to hand it also to some extent creates them by the subdivision of handicraft labour on the other hand it accomplishes this social organisation of the labourprocess only by riveting each labourer to a single fractional detail since the fractional product of each detail labourer is at the same time only a particular stage in the development of one and the same finished article each labourer or each group of labourers prepares the raw material for another labourer or group the result of the labour of the one is the startingpoint for the labour of the other the one workman therefore gives occupation directly to the other the labourtime necessary in each partial process for attaining the desired effect is learnt by experience and the mechanism of manufacture as a whole is based on the assumption that a given result will be obtained in a given time it is only on this assumption that the various supplementary labourprocesses can proceed uninterruptedly simultaneously and side by side it is clear that this direct dependence of the operations and therefore of the labourers on each other compels each one of them to spend on his work no more than the necessary time and thus a continuity uniformity regularity order and even intensity of labour of quite a different kind is begotten than is to be found in an independent handicraft or even in simple cooperation the rule that the labourtime expended on a commodity should not exceed that which is socially necessary for its production appears in the production of commodities generally to be established by the mere effect of competition since to express ourselves superficially each single producer is obliged to sell his commodity at its marketprice in manufacture on the contrary the turning out of a given quantum of product in a given time is a technical law of the process of production itself different operations take however unequal periods and yield therefore in equal times unequal quantities of fractional products if therefore the same labourer has day after day to perform the same operation there must be a different number of labourers for each operation for instance in type manufacture there are four founders and two breakers to one rubber the founder casts type an hour the breaker breaks up and the rubber polishes here we have again the principle of cooperation in its simplest form the simultaneous employment of many doing the same thing only now this principle is the expression of an organic relation the division of labour as carried out in manufacture not only simplifies and multiplies the qualitatively different parts of the social collective labourer but also creates a fixed mathematical relation or ratio which regulates the quantitative extent of those parts ie the relative number of labourers or the relative size of the group of labourers for each detail operation it develops along with the qualitative subdivision of the social labourprocess a quantitative rule and proportionality for that process when once the most fitting proportion has been experimentally established for the numbers of the detail labourers in the various groups when producing on a given scale that scale can be extended only by employing a multiple of each particular group there is this to boot that the same individual can do certain kinds of work just as well on a large as on a small scale for instance the labour of superintendence the carriage of the fractional product from one stage to the next c the isolation of such functions their allotment to a particular labourer does not become advantageous till after an increase in the number of labourers employed but this increase must affect every group proportionally the isolated group of labourers to whom any particular detail function is assigned is made up of homogeneous elements and is one of the constituent parts of the total mechanism in many manufactures however the group itself is an organised body of labour the total mechanism being a repetition or multiplication of these elementary organisms take for instance the manufacture of glass bottles it may be resolved into three essentially different stages first the preliminary stage consisting of the preparation of the components of the glass mixing the sand and lime c and melting them into a fluid mass of glass various detail labourers are employed in this first stage as also in the final one of removing the bottles from the drying furnace sorting and packing them c in the middle between these two stages comes the glass melting proper the manipulation of the fluid mass at each mouth of the furnace there works a group called “the hole” consisting of one bottlemaker or finisher one blower one gatherer one putterup or whetteroff and one takerin these five detail workers are so many special organs of a single working organism that acts only as a whole and therefore can operate only by the direct cooperation of the whole five the whole body is paralysed if but one of its members be wanting but a glass furnace has several openings in england from to each of which contains an earthenware meltingpot full of molten glass and employs a similar fivemembered group of workers the organisation of each group is based on division of labour but the bond between the different groups is simple cooperation which by using in common one of the means of production the furnace causes it to be more economically consumed such a furnace with its groups constitutes a glass house and a glass manufactory comprises a number of such glass houses together with the apparatus and workmen requisite for the preparatory and final stages finally just as manufacture arises in part from the combination of various handicrafts so too it develops into a combination of various manufactures the larger english glass manufacturers for instance make their own earthenware meltingpots because on the quality of these depends to a great extent the success or failure of the process the manufacture of one of the means of production is here united with that of the product on the other hand the manufacture of the product may be united with other manufactures of which that product is the raw material or with the products of which it is itself subsequently mixed thus we find the manufacture of flint glass combined with that of glass cutting and brass founding the latter for the metal settings of various articles of glass the various manufactures so combined form more or less separate departments of a larger manufacture but are at the same time independent processes each with its own division of labour in spite of the many advantages offered by this combination of manufactures it never grows into a complete technical system on its own foundation that happens only on its transformation into an industry carried on by machinery early in the manufacturing period the principle of lessening the necessary labourtime in the production of commodities was accepted and formulated and the use of machines especially for certain simple first processes that have to be conducted on a very large scale and with the application of great force sprang up here and there thus at an early period in paper manufacture the tearing up of the rags was done by papermills and in metal works the pounding of the ores was effected by stamping mills the roman empire had handed down the elementary form of all machinery in the waterwheel the handicraft period bequeathed to us the great inventions of the compass of gunpowder of typeprinting and of the automatic clock but on the whole machinery played that subordinate part which adam smith assigns to it in comparison with division of labour the sporadic use of machinery in the th century was of the greatest importance because it supplied the great mathematicians of that time with a practical basis and stimulant to the creation of the science of mechanics the collective labourer formed by the combination of a number of detail labourers is the machinery specially characteristic of the manufacturing period the various operations that are performed in turns by the producer of a commodity and coalesce one with another during the progress of production lay claim to him in various ways in one operation he must exert more strength in another more skill in another more attention and the same individual does not possess all these qualities in an equal degree after manufacture has once separated made independent and isolated the various operations the labourers are divided classified and grouped according to their predominating qualities if their natural endowments are on the one hand the foundation on which the division of labour is built up on the other hand manufacture once introduced develops in them new powers that are by nature fitted only for limited and special functions the collective labourer now possesses in an equal degree of excellence all the qualities requisite for production and expends them in the most economical manner by exclusively employing all his organs consisting of particular labourers or groups of labourers in performing their special functions the onesidedness and the deficiencies of the detail labourer become perfections when he is a part of the collective labourer the habit of doing only one thing converts him into a never failing instrument while his connexion with the whole mechanism compels him to work with the regularity of the parts of a machine since the collective labourer has functions both simple and complex both high and low his members the individual labourpowers require different degrees of training and must therefore have different values manufacture therefore develops a hierarchy of labourpowers to which there corresponds a scale of wages if on the one hand the individual labourers are appropriated and annexed for life by a limited function on the other hand the various operations of the hierarchy are parcelled out among the labourers according to both their natural and their acquired capabilities every process of production however requires certain simple manipulations which every man is capable of doing they too are now severed from their connexion with the more pregnant moments of activity and ossified into exclusive functions of specially appointed labourers hence manufacture begets in every handicraft that it seizes upon a class of socalled unskilled labourers a class which handicraft industry strictly excluded if it develops a onesided speciality into a perfection at the expense of the whole of a man’s working capacity it also begins to make a speciality of the absence of all development alongside of the hierarchic gradation there steps the simple separation of the labourers into skilled and unskilled for the latter the cost of apprenticeship vanishes for the former it diminishes compared with that of artificers in consequence of the functions being simplified in both cases the value of labourpower falls an exception to this law holds good whenever the decomposition of the labourprocess begets new and comprehensive functions that either had no place at all or only a very modest one in handicrafts the fall in the value of labourpower caused by the disappearance or diminution of the expenses of apprenticeship implies a direct increase of surplusvalue for the benefit of capital for everything that shortens the necessary labourtime required for the reproduction of labourpower extends the domain of surplus labour section division of labour in manufacture and division of labour in society we first considered the origin of manufacture then its simple elements then the detail labourer and his implements and finally the totality of the mechanism we shall now lightly touch upon the relation between the division of labour in manufacture and the social division of labour which forms the foundation of all production of commodities if we keep labour alone in view we may designate the separation of social production into its main divisions or genera – viz agriculture industries c as division of labour in general and the splitting up of these families into species and subspecies as division of labour in particular and the division of labour within the workshop as division of labour in singular or in detail division of labour in a society and the corresponding tying down of individuals to a particular calling develops itself just as does the division of labour in manufacture from opposite startingpoints within a family and after further development within a tribe there springs up naturally a division of labour caused by differences of sex and age a division that is consequently based on a purely physiological foundation which division enlarges its materials by the expansion of the community by the increase of population and more especially by the conflicts between different tribes and the subjugation of one tribe by another on the other hand as i have before remarked the exchange of products springs up at the points where different families tribes communities come in contact for in the beginning of civilisation it is not private individuals but families tribes c that meet on an independent footing different communities find different means of production and different means of subsistence in their natural environment hence their modes of production and of living and their products are different it is this spontaneously developed difference which when different communities come in contact calls forth the mutual exchange of products and the consequent gradual conversion of those products into commodities exchange does not create the differences between the spheres of production but brings what are already different into relation and thus converts them into more or less interdependent branches of the collective production of an enlarged society in the latter case the social division of labour arises from the exchange between spheres of production that are originally distinct and independent of one another in the former where the physiological division of labour is the startingpoint the particular organs of a compact whole grow loose and break off principally owing to the exchange of commodities with foreign communities and then isolate themselves so far that the sole bond still connecting the various kinds of work is the exchange of the products as commodities in the one case it is the making dependent what was before independent in the other case the making independent what was before dependent the foundation of every division of labour that is well developed and brought about by the exchange of commodities is the separation between town and country it may be said that the whole economic history of society is summed up in the movement of this antithesis we pass it over however for the present just as a certain number of simultaneously employed labourers are the material prerequisites for division of labour in manufacture so are the number and density of the population which here correspond to the agglomeration in one workshop a necessary condition for the division of labour in society nevertheless this density is more or less relative a relatively thinly populated country with welldeveloped means of communication has a denser population than a more numerously populated country with badlydeveloped means of communication and in this sense the northern states of the american union for instance are more thickly populated than india since the production and the circulation of commodities are the general prerequisites of the capitalist mode of production division of labour in manufacture demands that division of labour in society at large should previously have attained a certain degree of development inversely the former division reacts upon and develops and multiplies the latter simultaneously with the differentiation of the instruments of labour the industries that produce these instruments become more and more differentiated if the manufacturing system seize upon an industry which previously was carried on in connexion with others either as a chief or as a subordinate industry and by one producer these industries immediately separate their connexion and become independent if it seize upon a particular stage in the production of a commodity the other stages of its production become converted into so many independent industries it has already been stated that where the finished article consists merely of a number of parts fitted together the detail operations may reestablish themselves as genuine and separate handicrafts in order to carry out more perfectly the division of labour in manufacture a single branch of production is according to the varieties of its raw material or the various forms that one and the same raw material may assume split up into numerous and to some extent entirely new manufactures accordingly in france alone in the first half of the th century over different kinds of silk stuffs were woven and in avignon it was law that “every apprentice should devote himself to only one sort of fabrication and should not learn the preparation of several kinds of stuff at once” the territorial division of labour which confines special branches of production to special districts of a country acquires fresh stimulus from the manufacturing system which exploits every special advantage the colonial system and the opening out of the markets of the world both of which are included in the general conditions of existence of the manufacturing period furnish rich material for developing the division of labour in society it is not the place here to go on to show how division of labour seizes upon not only the economic but every other sphere of society and everywhere lays the foundation of that all engrossing system of specialising and sorting men that development in a man of one single faculty at the expense of all other faculties which caused a ferguson the master of adam smith to exclaim “we make a nation of helots and have no free citizens” but in spite of the numerous analogies and links connecting them division of labour in the interior of a society and that in the interior of a workshop differ not only in degree but also in kind the analogy appears most indisputable where there is an invisible bond uniting the various branches of trade for instance the cattlebreeder produces hides the tanner makes the hides into leather and the shoemaker the leather into boots here the thing produced by each of them is but a step towards the final form which is the product of all their labours combined there are besides all the various industries that supply the cattlebreeder the tanner and the shoemaker with the means of production now it is quite possible to imagine with adam smith that the difference between the above social division of labour and the division in manufacture is merely subjective exists merely for the observer who in a manufacture can see with one glance all the numerous operations being performed on one spot while in the instance given above the spreading out of the work over great areas and the great number of people employed in each branch of labour obscure the connexion but what is it that forms the bond between the independent labours of the cattlebreeder the tanner and the shoemaker it is the fact that their respective products are commodities what on the other hand characterises division of labour in manufactures the fact that the detail labourer produces no commodities it is only the common product of all the detail labourers that becomes a commodity division of labour in society is brought about by the purchase and sale of the products of different branches of industry while the connexion between the detail operations in a workshop is due to the sale of the labourpower of several workmen to one capitalist who applies it as combined labourpower the division of labour in the workshop implies concentration of the means of production in the hands of one capitalist the division of labour in society implies their dispersion among many independent producers of commodities while within the workshop the iron law of proportionality subjects definite numbers of workmen to definite functions in the society outside the workshop chance and caprice have full play in distributing the producers and their means of production among the various branches of industry the different spheres of production it is true constantly tend to an equilibrium for on the one hand while each producer of a commodity is bound to produce a usevalue to satisfy a particular social want and while the extent of these wants differs quantitatively still there exists an inner relation which settles their proportions into a regular system and that system one of spontaneous growth and on the other hand the law of the value of commodities ultimately determines how much of its disposable workingtime society can expend on each particular class of commodities but this constant tendency to equilibrium of the various spheres of production is exercised only in the shape of a reaction against the constant upsetting of this equilibrium the a priori system on which the division of labour within the workshop is regularly carried out becomes in the division of labour within the society an a posteriori natureimposed necessity controlling the lawless caprice of the producers and perceptible in the barometrical fluctuations of the marketprices division of labour within the workshop implies the undisputed authority of the capitalist over men that are but parts of a mechanism that belongs to him the division of labour within the society brings into contact independent commodityproducers who acknowledge no other authority but that of competition of the coercion exerted by the pressure of their mutual interests just as in the animal kingdom the bellum omnium contra omnes war of all against all – hobbes more or less preserves the conditions of existence of every species the same bourgeois mind which praises division of labour in the workshop lifelong annexation of the labourer to a partial operation and his complete subjection to capital as being an organisation of labour that increases its productiveness that same bourgeois mind denounces with equal vigour every conscious attempt to socially control and regulate the process of production as an inroad upon such sacred things as the rights of property freedom and unrestricted play for the bent of the individual capitalist it is very characteristic that the enthusiastic apologists of the factory system have nothing more damning to urge against a general organisation of the labour of society than that it would turn all society into one immense factory if in a society with capitalist production anarchy in the social division of labour and despotism in that of the workshop are mutual conditions the one of the other we find on the contrary in those earlier forms of society in which the separation of trades has been spontaneously developed then crystallised and finally made permanent by law on the one hand a specimen of the organisation of the labour of society in accordance with an approved and authoritative plan and on the other the entire exclusion of division of labour in the workshop or at all events a mere dwarflike or sporadic and accidental development of the same those small and extremely ancient indian communities some of which have continued down to this day are based on possession in common of the land on the blending of agriculture and handicrafts and on an unalterable division of labour which serves whenever a new community is started as a plan and scheme ready cut and dried occupying areas of from up to several thousand acres each forms a compact whole producing all it requires the chief part of the products is destined for direct use by the community itself and does not take the form of a commodity hence production here is independent of that division of labour brought about in indian society as a whole by means of the exchange of commodities it is the surplus alone that becomes a commodity and a portion of even that not until it has reached the hands of the state into whose hands from time immemorial a certain quantity of these products has found its way in the shape of rent in kind the constitution of these communities varies in different parts of india in those of the simplest form the land is tilled in common and the produce divided among the members at the same time spinning and weaving are carried on in each family as subsidiary industries side by side with the masses thus occupied with one and the same work we find the “chief inhabitant” who is judge police and taxgatherer in one the bookkeeper who keeps the accounts of the tillage and registers everything relating thereto another official who prosecutes criminals protects strangers travelling through and escorts them to the next village the boundary man who guards the boundaries against neighbouring communities the wateroverseer who distributes the water from the common tanks for irrigation the brahmin who conducts the religious services the schoolmaster who on the sand teaches the children reading and writing the calendarbrahmin or astrologer who makes known the lucky or unlucky days for seedtime and harvest and for every other kind of agricultural work a smith and a carpenter who make and repair all the agricultural implements the potter who makes all the pottery of the village the barber the washerman who washes clothes the silversmith here and there the poet who in some communities replaces the silversmith in others the schoolmaster this dozen of individuals is maintained at the expense of the whole community if the population increases a new community is founded on the pattern of the old one on unoccupied land the whole mechanism discloses a systematic division of labour but a division like that in manufactures is impossible since the smith and the carpenter c find an unchanging market and at the most there occur according to the sizes of the villages two or three of each instead of one the law that regulates the division of labour in the community acts with the irresistible authority of a law of nature at the same time that each individual artificer the smith the carpenter and so on conducts in his workshop all the operations of his handicraft in the traditional way but independently and without recognising any authority over him the simplicity of the organisation for production in these selfsufficing communities that constantly reproduce themselves in the same form and when accidentally destroyed spring up again on the spot and with the same name this simplicity supplies the key to the secret of the unchangeableness of asiatic societies an unchangeableness in such striking contrast with the constant dissolution and refounding of asiatic states and the neverceasing changes of dynasty the structure of the economic elements of society remains untouched by the stormclouds of the political sky the rules of the guilds as i have said before by limiting most strictly the number of apprentices and journeymen that a single master could employ prevented him from becoming a capitalist moreover he could not employ his journeymen in many other handicrafts than the one in which he was a master the guilds zealously repelled every encroachment by the capital of merchants the only form of free capital with which they came in contact a merchant could buy every kind of commodity but labour as a commodity he could not buy he existed only on sufferance as a dealer in the products of the handicrafts if circumstances called for a further division of labour the existing guilds split themselves up into varieties or founded new guilds by the side of the old ones all this however without concentrating various handicrafts in a single workshop hence the guild organisation however much it may have contributed by separating isolating and perfecting the handicrafts to create the material conditions for the existence of manufacture excluded division of labour in the workshop on the whole the labourer and his means of production remained closely united like the snail with its shell and thus there was wanting the principal basis of manufacture the separation of the labourer from his means of production and the conversion of these means into capital while division of labour in society at large whether such division be brought about or not by exchange of commodities is common to economic formations of society the most diverse division of labour in the workshop as practised by manufacture is a special creation of the capitalist mode of production alone section the capitalistic character of manufacture an increased number of labourers under the control of one capitalist is the natural startingpoint as well of cooperation generally as of manufacture in particular but the division of labour in manufacture makes this increase in the number of workmen a technical necessity the minimum number that any given capitalist is bound to employ is here prescribed by the previously established division of labour on the other hand the advantages of further division are obtainable only by adding to the number of workmen and this can be done only by adding multiples of the various detail groups but an increase in the variable component of the capital employed necessitates an increase in its constant component too in the workshops implements c and in particular in the raw material the call for which grows quicker than the number of workmen the quantity of it consumed in a given time by a given amount of labour increases in the same ratio as does the productive power of that labour in consequence of its division hence it is a law based on the very nature of manufacture that the minimum amount of capital which is bound to be in the hands of each capitalist must keep increasing in other words that the transformation into capital of the social means of production and subsistence must keep extending in manufacture as well as in simple cooperation the collective working organism is a form of existence of capital the mechanism that is made up of numerous individual detail labourers belongs to the capitalist hence the productive power resulting from a combination of labours appears to be the productive power of capital manufacture proper not only subjects the previously independent workman to the discipline and command of capital but in addition creates a hierarchic gradation of the workmen themselves while simple cooperation leaves the mode of working by the individual for the most part unchanged manufacture thoroughly revolutionises it and seizes labourpower by its very roots it converts the labourer into a crippled monstrosity by forcing his detail dexterity at the expense of a world of productive capabilities and instincts just as in the states of la plata they butcher a whole beast for the sake of his hide or his tallow not only is the detail work distributed to the different individuals but the individual himself is made the automatic motor of a fractional operation and the absurd fable of menenius agrippa which makes man a mere fragment of his own body becomes realised if at first the workman sells his labourpower to capital because the material means of producing a commodity fail him now his very labourpower refuses its services unless it has been sold to capital its functions can be exercised only in an environment that exists in the workshop of the capitalist after the sale by nature unfitted to make anything independently the manufacturing labourer develops productive activity as a mere appendage of the capitalist’s workshop as the chosen people bore in their features the sign manual of jehovah so division of labour brands the manufacturing workman as the property of capital the knowledge the judgement and the will which though in ever so small a degree are practised by the independent peasant or handicraftsman in the same way as the savage makes the whole art of war consist in the exercise of his personal cunning these faculties are now required only for the workshop as a whole intelligence in production expands in one direction because it vanishes in many others what is lost by the detail labourers is concentrated in the capital that employs them it is a result of the division of labour in manufactures that the labourer is brought face to face with the intellectual potencies of the material process of production as the property of another and as a ruling power this separation begins in simple cooperation where the capitalist represents to the single workman the oneness and the will of the associated labour it is developed in manufacture which cuts down the labourer into a detail labourer it is completed in modern industry which makes science a productive force distinct from labour and presses it into the service of capital in manufacture in order to make the collective labourer and through him capital rich in social productive power each labourer must be made poor in individual productive powers “ignorance is the mother of industry as well as of superstition reflection and fancy are subject to err but a habit of moving the hand or the foot is independent of either manufactures accordingly prosper most where the mind is least consulted and where the workshop may be considered as an engine the parts of which are men” as a matter of fact some few manufacturers in the middle of the th century preferred for certain operations that were trade secrets to employ halfidiotic persons “the understandings of the greater part of men” says adam smith “are necessarily formed by their ordinary employments the man whose whole life is spent in performing a few simple operations has no occasion to exert his understanding he generally becomes as stupid and ignorant as it is possible for a human creature to become” after describing the stupidity of the detail labourer he goes on “the uniformity of his stationary life naturally corrupts the courage of his mind it corrupts even the activity of his body and renders him incapable of exerting his strength with vigour and perseverance in any other employments than that to which he has been bred his dexterity at his own particular trade seems in this manner to be acquired at the expense of his intellectual social and martial virtues but in every improved and civilised society this is the state into which the labouring poor that is the great body of the people must necessarily fall” for preventing the complete deterioration of the great mass of the people by division of labour a smith recommends education of the people by the state but prudently and in homeopathic doses g garnier his french translator and commentator who under the first french empire quite naturally developed into a senator quite as naturally opposes him on this point education of the masses he urges violates the first law of the division of labour and with it “our whole social system would be proscribed” like all other divisions of labour” he says “that between hand labour and head labour is more pronounced and decided in proportion as society he rightly uses this word for capital landed property and their state becomes richer this division of labour like every other is an effect of past and a cause of future progress ought the government then to work in opposition to this division of labour and to hinder its natural course ought it to expend a part of the public money in the attempt to confound and blend together two classes of labour which are striving after division and separation” some crippling of body and mind is inseparable even from division of labour in society as a whole since however manufacture carries this social separation of branches of labour much further and also by its peculiar division attacks the individual at the very roots of his life it is the first to afford the materials for and to give a start to industrial pathology “to subdivide a man is to execute him if he deserves the sentence to assassinate him if he does not the subdivision of labour is the assassination of a people” cooperation based on division of labour in other words manufacture commences as a spontaneous formation so soon as it attains some consistence and extension it becomes the recognised methodical and systematic form of capitalist production history shows how the division of labour peculiar to manufacture strictly so called acquires the best adapted form at first by experience as it were behind the backs of the actors and then like the guild handicrafts strives to hold fast that form when once found and here and there succeeds in keeping it for centuries any alteration in this form except in trivial matters is solely owing to a revolution in the instruments of labour modern manufacture wherever it arises i do not here allude to modern industry based on machinery either finds the disjecta membra poetae ready to hand and only waiting to be collected together as is the case in the manufacture of clothes in large towns or it can easily apply the principle of division simply by exclusively assigning the various operations of a handicraft such as bookbinding to particular men in such cases a week’s experience is enough to determine the proportion between the numbers of the hands necessary for the various functions by decomposition of handicrafts by specialisation of the instruments of labour by the formation of detail labourers and by grouping and combining the latter into a single mechanism division of labour in manufacture creates a qualitative gradation and a quantitative proportion in the social process of production it consequently creates a definite organisation of the labour of society and thereby develops at the same time new productive forces in the society in its specific capitalist form and under the given conditions it could take no other form than a capitalistic one manufacture is but a particular method of begetting relative surplusvalue or of augmenting at the expense of the labourer the selfexpansion of capital usually called social wealth “wealth of nations” c it increases the social productive power of labour not only for the benefit of the capitalist instead of for that of the labourer but it does this by crippling the individual labourers it creates new conditions for the lordship of capital over labour if therefore on the one hand it presents itself historically as a progress and as a necessary phase in the economic development of society on the other hand it is a refined and civilised method of exploitation political economy which as an independent science first sprang into being during the period of manufacture views the social division of labour only from the standpoint of manufacture and sees in it only the means of producing more commodities with a given quantity of labour and consequently of cheapening commodities and hurrying on the accumulation of capital in most striking contrast with this accentuation of quantity and exchangevalue is the attitude of the writers of classical antiquity who hold exclusively by quality and usevalue in consequence of the separation of the social branches of production commodities are better made the various bents and talents of men select a suitable field and without some restraint no important results can be obtained anywhere hence both product and producer are improved by division of labour if the growth of the quantity produced is occasionally mentioned this is only done with reference to the greater abundance of usevalues there is not a word alluding to exchangevalue or to the cheapening of commodities this aspect from the standpoint of usevalue alone is taken as well by plato who treats division of labour as the foundation on which the division of society into classes is based as by xenophon who with characteristic bourgeois instinct approaches more nearly to division of labour within the workshop plato’s republic in so far as division of labour is treated in it as the formative principle of the state is merely the athenian idealisation of the egyptian system of castes egypt having served as the model of an industrial country to many of his contemporaries also amongst others to isocrates and it continued to have this importance to the greeks of the roman empire during the manufacturing period proper ie the period during which manufacture is the predominant form taken by capitalist production many obstacles are opposed to the full development of the peculiar tendencies of manufacture although manufacture creates as we have already seen a simple separation of the labourers into skilled and unskilled simultaneously with their hierarchic arrangement in classes yet the number of the unskilled labourers owing to the preponderating influence of the skilled remains very limited although it adapts the detail operations to the various degrees of maturity strength and development of the living instruments of labour thus conducing to exploitation of women and children yet this tendency as a whole is wrecked on the habits and the resistance of the male labourers although the splitting up of handicrafts lowers the cost of forming the workman and thereby lowers his value yet for the more difficult detail work a longer apprenticeship is necessary and even where it would be superfluous is jealously insisted upon by the workmen in england for instance we find the laws of apprenticeship with their seven years’ probation in full force down to the end of the manufacturing period and they are not thrown on one side till the advent of modern industry since handicraft skill is the foundation of manufacture and since the mechanism of manufacture as a whole possesses no framework apart from the labourers themselves capital is constantly compelled to wrestle with the insubordination of the workmen “by the infirmity of human nature” says friend ure “it happens that the more skilful the workman the more selfwilled and intractable he is apt to become and of course the less fit a component of a mechanical system in which he may do great damage to the whole” hence throughout the whole manufacturing period there runs the complaint of want of discipline among the workmen and had we not the testimony of contemporary writers the simple facts that during the period between the th century and the epoch of modern industry capital failed to become the master of the whole disposable workingtime of the manufacturing labourers that manufactures are shortlived and change their locality from one country to another with the emigrating or immigrating workmen these facts would speak volumes “order must in one way or another be established” exclaims in the oftcited author of the “essay on trade and commerce” “order” reechoes dr andrew ure years later “order” was wanting in manufacture based on “the scholastic dogma of division of labour” and “arkwright created order” at the same time manufacture was unable either to seize upon the production of society to its full extent or to revolutionise that production to its very core it towered up as an economic work of art on the broad foundation of the town handicrafts and of the rural domestic industries at a given stage in its development the narrow technical basis on which manufacture rested came into conflict with requirements of production that were created by manufacture itself one of its most finished creations was the workshop for the production of the instruments of labour themselves including especially the complicated mechanical apparatus then already employed a machinefactory says ure “displayed the division of labour in manifold gradations the file the drill the lathe having each its different workman in the order of skill” p this workshop the product of the division of labour in manufacture produced in its turn machines it is they that sweep away the handicraftsman’s work as the regulating principle of social production thus on the one hand the technical reason for the lifelong annexation of the workman to a detail function is removed on the other hand the fetters that this same principle laid on the dominion of capital fall away chapter machinery and modern industry section the development of machinery john stuart mill says in his “principles of political economy “it is questionable if all the mechanical inventions yet made have lightened the day’s toil of any human being” that is however by no means the aim of the capitalistic application of machinery like every other increase in the productiveness of labour machinery is intended to cheapen commodities and by shortening that portion of the working day in which the labourer works for himself to lengthen the other portion that he gives without an equivalent to the capitalist in short it is a means for producing surplusvalue in manufacture the revolution in the mode of production begins with the labourpower in modern industry it begins with the instruments of labour our first inquiry then is how the instruments of labour are converted from tools into machines or what is the difference between a machine and the implements of a handicraft we are only concerned here with striking and general characteristics for epochs in the history of society are no more separated from each other by hard and fast lines of demarcation than are geological epochs mathematicians and mechanicians and in this they are followed by a few english economists call a tool a simple machine and a machine a complex tool they see no essential difference between them and even give the name of machine to the simple mechanical powers the lever the inclined plane the screw the wedge c as a matter of fact every machine is a combination of those simple powers no matter how they may be disguised from the economic standpoint this explanation is worth nothing because the historical element is wanting another explanation of the difference between tool and machine is that in the case of a tool man is the motive power while the motive power of a machine is something different from man as for instance an animal water wind and so on according to this a plough drawn by oxen which is a contrivance common to the most different epochs would be a machine while claussen’s circular loom which worked by a single labourer weaves picks per minute would be a mere tool nay this very loom though a tool when worked by hand would if worked by steam be a machine and since the application of animal power is one of man’s earliest inventions production by machinery would have preceded production by handicrafts when in john wyatt brought out his spinning machine and began the industrial revolution of the th century not a word did he say about an ass driving it instead of a man and yet this part fell to the ass he described it as a machine “to spin without fingers” all fully developed machinery consists of three essentially different parts the motor mechanism the transmitting mechanism and finally the tool or working machine the motor mechanism is that which puts the whole in motion it either generates its own motive power like the steamengine the caloric engine the electromagnetic machine c or it receives its impulse from some already existing natural force like the waterwheel from a head of water the windmill from wind c the transmitting mechanism composed of flywheels shafting toothed wheels pullies straps ropes bands pinions and gearing of the most varied kinds regulates the motion changes its form where necessary as for instance from linear to circular and divides and distributes it among the working machines these two first parts of the whole mechanism are there solely for putting the working machines in motion by means of which motion the subject of labour is seized upon and modified as desired the tool or working machine is that part of the machinery with which the industrial revolution of the th century started and to this day it constantly serves as such a startingpoint whenever a handicraft or a manufacture is turned into an industry carried on by machinery on a closer examination of the working machine proper we find in it as a general rule though often no doubt under very altered forms the apparatus and tools used by the handicraftsman or manufacturing workman with this difference that instead of being human implements they are the implements of a mechanism or mechanical implements either the entire machine is only a more or less altered mechanical edition of the old handicraft tool as for instance the powerloom or the working parts fitted in the frame of the machine are old acquaintances as spindles are in a mule needles in a stockingloom saws in a sawingmachine and knives in a chopping machine the distinction between these tools and the body proper of the machine exists from their very birth for they continue for the most part to be produced by handicraft or by manufacture and are afterwards fitted into the body of the machine which is the product of machinery the machine proper is therefore a mechanism that after being set in motion performs with its tools the same operations that were formerly done by the workman with similar tools whether the motive power is derived from man or from some other machine makes no difference in this respect from the moment that the tool proper is taken from man and fitted into a mechanism a machine takes the place of a mere implement the difference strikes one at once even in those cases where man himself continues to be the prime mover the number of implements that he himself can use simultaneously is limited by the number of his own natural instruments of production by the number of his bodily organs in germany they tried at first to make one spinner work two spinningwheels that is to work simultaneously with both hands and both feet this was too difficult later a treddle spinningwheel with two spindles was invented but adepts in spinning who could spin two threads at once were almost as scarce as twoheaded men the jenny on the other hand even at its very birth spun with spindles and the stockingloom knits with many thousand needles at once the number of tools that a machine can bring into play simultaneously is from the very first emancipated from the organic limits that hedge in the tools of a handicraftsman in many manual implements the distinction between man as mere motive power and man as the workman or operator properly so called is brought into striking contrast for instance the foot is merely the prime mover of the spinningwheel while the hand working with the spindle and drawing and twisting performs the real operation of spinning it is this last part of the handicraftsman’s implement that is first seized upon by the industrial revolution leaving to the workman in addition to his new labour of watching the machine with his eyes and correcting its mistakes with his hands the merely mechanical part of being the moving power on the other hand implements in regard to which man has always acted as a simple motive power as for instance by turning the crank of a mill by pumping by moving up and down the arm of a bellows by pounding with a mortar c such implements soon call for the application of animals water and wind as motive powers here and there long before the period of manufacture and also to some extent during that period these implements pass over into machines but without creating any revolution in the mode of production it becomes evident in the period of modern industry that these implements even under their form of manual tools are already machines for instance the pumps with which the dutch in emptied the lake of harlem were constructed on the principle of ordinary pumps the only difference being that their pistons were driven by cyclopean steamengines instead of by men the common and very imperfect bellows of the blacksmith is in england occasionally converted into a blowingengine by connecting its arm with a steamengine the steamengine itself such as it was at its invention during the manufacturing period at the close of the th century and such as it continued to be down to did not give rise to any industrial revolution it was on the contrary the invention of machines that made a revolution in the form of steamengines necessary as soon as man instead of working with an implement on the subject of his labour becomes merely the motive power of an implementmachine it is a mere accident that motive power takes the disguise of human muscle and it may equally well take the form of wind water or steam of course this does not prevent such a change of form from producing great technical alterations in the mechanism that was originally constructed to be driven by man alone nowadays all machines that have their way to make such as sewingmachines breadmaking machines c are unless from their very nature their use on a small scale is excluded constructed to be driven both by human and by purely mechanical motive power the machine which is the startingpoint of the industrial revolution supersedes the workman who handles a single tool by a mechanism operating with a number of similar tools and set in motion by a single motive power whatever the form of that power may be here we have the machine but only as an elementary factor of production by machinery increase in the size of the machine and in the number of its working tools calls for a more massive mechanism to drive it and this mechanism requires in order to overcome its resistance a mightier moving power than that of man apart from the fact that man is a very imperfect instrument for producing uniform continued motion but assuming that he is acting simply as a motor that a machine has taken the place of his tool it is evident that he can be replaced by natural forces of all the great motors handed down from the manufacturing period horsepower is the worst partly because a horse has a head of his own partly because he is costly and the extent to which he is applicable in factories is very restricted nevertheless the horse was extensively used during the infancy of modern industry this is proved as well by the complaints of contemporary agriculturists as by the term “horsepower” which has survived to this day as an expression for mechanical force wind was too inconstant and uncontrollable and besides in england the birthplace of modern industry the use of water power preponderated even during the manufacturing period in the th century attempts had already been made to turn two pairs of millstones with a single waterwheel but the increased size of the gearing was too much for the water power which had now become insufficient and this was one of the circumstances that led to a more accurate investigation of the laws of friction in the same way the irregularity caused by the motive power in mills that were put in motion by pushing and pulling a lever led to the theory and the application of the flywheel which afterwards plays so important a part in modern industry in this way during the manufacturing period were developed the first scientific and technical elements of modern mechanical industry arkwright’s throstle spinning mill was from the very first turned by water but for all that the use of water as the predominant motive power was beset with difficulties it could not be increased at will it failed at certain seasons of the year and above all it was essentially local not till the invention of watt’s second and socalled doubleacting steamengine was a prime mover found that begot its own force by the consumption of coal and water whose power was entirely under man’s control that was mobile and a means of locomotion that was urban and not like the waterwheel rural that permitted production to be concentrated in towns instead of like the waterwheels being scattered up and down the country that was of universal technical application and relatively speaking little affected in its choice of residence by local circumstances the greatness of watt’s genius showed itself in the specification of the patent that he took out in april in that specification his steamengine is described not as an invention for a specific purpose but as an agent universally applicable in mechanical industry in it he points out applications many of which as for instance the steamhammer were not introduced till half a century later nevertheless he doubted the use of steamengines in navigation his successors boulton and watt sent to the exhibition of steamengines of colossal size for ocean steamers as soon as tools had been converted from being manual implements of man into implements of a mechanical apparatus of a machine the motive mechanism also acquired an independent form entirely emancipated from the restraints of human strength thereupon the individual machine that we have hitherto been considering sinks into a mere factor in production by machinery one motive mechanism was now able to drive many machines at once the motive mechanism grows with the number of the machines that are turned simultaneously and the transmitting mechanism becomes a widespreading apparatus we now proceed to distinguish the cooperation of a number of machines of one kind from a complex system of machinery in the one case the product is entirely made by a single machine which performs all the various operations previously done by one handicraftsman with his tool as for instance by a weaver with his loom or by several handicraftsman successively either separately or as members of a system of manufacture for example in the manufacture of envelopes one man folded the paper with the folder another laid on the gum a third turned the flap over on which the device is impressed a fourth embossed the device and so on and for each of these operations the envelope had to change hands one single envelope machine now performs all these operations at once and makes more than envelopes in an hour in the london exhibition of there was an american machine for making paper cornets it cut the paper pasted folded and finished in a minute here the whole process which when carried on as manufacture was split up into and carried out by a series of operations is completed by a single machine working a combination of various tools now whether such a machine be merely a reproduction of a complicated manual implement or a combination of various simple implements specialised by manufacture in either case in the factory ie in the workshop in which machinery alone is used we meet again with simple cooperation and leaving the workman out of consideration for the moment this cooperation presents itself to us in the first instance as the conglomeration in one place of similar and simultaneously acting machines thus a weaving factory is constituted of a number of powerlooms working side by side and a sewing factory of a number of sewingmachines all in the same building but there is here a technical oneness in the whole system owing to all the machines receiving their impulse simultaneously and in an equal degree from the pulsations of the common prime mover by the intermediary of the transmitting mechanism and this mechanism to a certain extent is also common to them all since only particular ramifications of it branch off to each machine just as a number of tools then form the organs of a machine so a number of machines of one kind constitute the organs of the motive mechanism a real machinery system however does not take the place of these independent machines until the subject of labour goes through a connected series of detail processes that are carried out by a chain of machines of various kinds the one supplementing the other here we have again the cooperation by division of labour that characterises manufacture only now it is a combination of detail machines the special tools of the various detail workmen such as those of the beaters cambers spinners c in the woollen manufacture are now transformed into the tools of specialised machines each machine constituting a special organ with a special function in the system in those branches of industry in which the machinery system is first introduced manufacture itself furnishes in a general way the natural basis for the division and consequent organisation of the process of production nevertheless an essential difference at once manifests itself in manufacture it is the workmen who with their manual implements must either singly or in groups carry on each particular detail process if on the one hand the workman becomes adapted to the process on the other the process was previously made suitable to the workman this subjective principle of the division of labour no longer exists in production by machinery here the process as a whole is examined objectively in itself that is to say without regard to the question of its execution by human hands it is analysed into its constituent phases and the problem how to execute each detail process and bind them all into a whole is solved by the aid of machines chemistry c but of course in this case also theory must be perfected by accumulated experience on a large scale each detail machine supplies raw material to the machine next in order and since they are all working at the same time the product is always going through the various stages of its fabrication and is also constantly in a state of transition from one phase to another just as in manufacture the direct cooperation of the detail labourers establishes a numerical proportion between the special groups so in an organised system of machinery where one detail machine is constantly kept employed by another a fixed relation is established between their numbers their size and their speed the collective machine now an organised system of various kinds of single machines and of groups of single machines becomes more and more perfect the more the process as a whole becomes a continuous one ie the less the raw material is interrupted in its passage from its first phase to its last in other words the more its passage from one phase to another is effected not by the hand of man but by the machinery itself in manufacture the isolation of each detail process is a condition imposed by the nature of division of labour but in the fully developed factory the continuity of those processes is on the contrary imperative a system of machinery whether it reposes on the mere cooperation of similar machines as in weaving or on a combination of different machines as in spinning constitutes in itself a huge automaton whenever it is driven by a selfacting prime mover but although the factory as a whole be driven by its steamengine yet either some of the individual machines may require the aid of the workman for some of their movements such aid was necessary for the running in of the mule carriage before the invention of the selfacting mule and is still necessary in finespinning mills or to enable a machine to do its work certain parts of it may require to be handled by the workman like a manual tool this was the case in machinemakers’ workshops before the conversion of the slide rest into a selfactor as soon as a machine executes without man’s help all the movements requisite to elaborate the raw material needing only attendance from him we have an automatic system of machinery and one that is susceptible of constant improvement in its details such improvements as the apparatus that stops a drawing frame whenever a sliver breaks and the selfacting stop that stops the powerloom so soon as the shuttle bobbin is emptied of weft are quite modern inventions as an example both of continuity of production and of the carrying out of the automatic principle we may take a modern paper mill in the paper industry generally we may advantageously study in detail not only the distinctions between modes of production based on different means of production but also the connexion of the social conditions of production with those modes for the old german papermaking furnishes us with a sample of handicraft production that of holland in the th and of france in the th century with a sample of manufacturing in the strict sense and that of modern england with a sample of automatic fabrication of this article besides these there still exist in india and china two distinct antique asiatic forms of the same industry an organised system of machines to which motion is communicated by the transmitting mechanism from a central automaton is the most developed form of production by machinery here we have in the place of the isolated machine a mechanical monster whose body fills whole factories and whose demon power at first veiled under the slow and measured motions of his giant limbs at length breaks out into the fast and furious whirl of his countless working organs there were mules and steamengines before there were any labourers whose exclusive occupation it was to make mules and steamengines just as men wore clothes before there were such people as tailors the inventions of vaucanson arkwright watt and others were however practicable only because those inventors found ready to hand a considerable number of skilled mechanical workmen placed at their disposal by the manufacturing period some of these workmen were independent handicraftsman of various trades others were grouped together in manufactures in which as beforementioned division of labour was strictly carried out as inventions increased in number and the demand for the newly discovered machines grew larger the machinemaking industry split up more and more into numerous independent branches and division of labour in these manufactures was more and more developed here then we see in manufacture the immediate technical foundation of modern industry manufacture produced the machinery by means of which modern industry abolished the handicraft and manufacturing systems in those spheres of production that it first seized upon the factory system was therefore raised in the natural course of things on an inadequate foundation when the system attained to a certain degree of development it had to root up this readymade foundation which in the meantime had been elaborated on the old lines and to build up for itself a basis that should correspond to its methods of production just as the individual machine retains a dwarfish character so long as it is worked by the power of man alone and just as no system of machinery could be properly developed before the steamengine took the place of the earlier motive powers animals wind and even water so too modern industry was crippled in its complete development so long as its characteristic instrument of production the machine owed its existence to personal strength and personal skill and depended on the muscular development the keenness of sight and the cunning of hand with which the detail workmen in manufactures and the manual labourers in handicrafts wielded their dwarfish implements thus apart from the dearness of the machines made in this way a circumstance that is ever present to the mind of the capitalist the expansion of industries carried on by means of machinery and the invasion by machinery of fresh branches of production were dependent on the growth of a class of workmen who owing to the almost artistic nature of their employment could increase their numbers only gradually and not by leaps and bounds but besides this at a certain stage of its development modern industry became technologically incompatible with the basis furnished for it by handicraft and manufacture the increasing size of the prime movers of the transmitting mechanism and of the machines proper the greater complication multiformity and regularity of the details of these machines as they more and more departed from the model of those originally made by manual labour and acquired a form untrammelled except by the conditions under which they worked the perfecting of the automatic system and the use every day more unavoidable of a more refractory material such as iron instead of wood the solution of all these problems which sprang up by the force of circumstances everywhere met with a stumblingblock in the personal restrictions which even the collective labourer of manufacture could not break through except to a limited extent such machines as the modern hydraulic press the modern powerloom and the modern carding engine could never have been furnished by manufacture a radical change in the mode of production in one sphere of industry involves a similar change in other spheres this happens at first in such branches of industry as are connected together by being separate phases of a process and yet are isolated by the social division of labour in such a way that each of them produces an independent commodity thus spinning by machinery made weaving by machinery a necessity and both together made the mechanical and chemical revolution that took place in bleaching printing and dyeing imperative so too on the other hand the revolution in cottonspinning called forth the invention of the gin for separating the seeds from the cotton fibre it was only by means of this invention that the production of cotton became possible on the enormous scale at present required but more especially the revolution in the modes of production of industry and agriculture made necessary a revolution in the general conditions of the social process of production ie in the means of communication and of transport in a society whose pivot to use an expression of fourier was agriculture on a small scale with its subsidiary domestic industries and the urban handicrafts the means of communication and transport were so utterly inadequate to the productive requirements of the manufacturing period with its extended division of social labour its concentration of the instruments of labour and of the workmen and its colonial markets that they became in fact revolutionised in the same way the means of communication and transport handed down from the manufacturing period soon became unbearable trammels on modern industry with its feverish haste of production its enormous extent its constant flinging of capital and labour from one sphere of production into another and its newlycreated connexions with the markets of the whole world hence apart from the radical changes introduced in the construction of sailing vessels the means of communication and transport became gradually adapted to the modes of production of mechanical industry by the creation of a system of river steamers railways ocean steamers and telegraphs but the huge masses of iron that had now to be forged to be welded to be cut to be bored and to be shaped demanded on their part cyclopean machines for the construction of which the methods of the manufacturing period were utterly inadequate modern industry had therefore itself to take in hand the machine its characteristic instrument of production and to construct machines by machines it was not till it did this that it built up for itself a fitting technical foundation and stood on its own feet machinery simultaneously with the increasing use of it in the first decades of this century appropriated by degrees the fabrication of machines proper but it was only during the decade preceding that the construction of railways and ocean steamers on a stupendous scale called into existence the cyclopean machines now employed in the construction of prime movers the most essential condition to the production of machines by machines was a prime mover capable of exerting any amount of force and yet under perfect control such a condition was already supplied by the steamengine but at the same time it was necessary to produce the geometrically accurate straight lines planes circles cylinders cones and spheres required in the detail parts of the machines this problem henry maudsley solved in the first decade of this century by the invention of the slide rest a tool that was soon made automatic and in a modified form was applied to other constructive machines besides the lathe for which it was originally intended this mechanical appliance replaces not some particular tool but the hand itself which produces a given form by holding and guiding the cutting tool along the iron or other material operated upon thus it became possible to produce the forms of the individual parts of machinery “with a degree of ease accuracy and speed that no accumulated experience of the hand of the most skilled workman could give” if we now fix our attention on that portion of the machinery employed in the construction of machines which constitutes the operating tool we find the manual implements reappearing but on a cyclopean scale the operating part of the boring machine is an immense drill driven by a steamengine without this machine on the other hand the cylinders of large steamengines and of hydraulic presses could not be made the mechanical lathe is only a cyclopean reproduction of the ordinary footlathe the planing machine an iron carpenter that works on iron with the same tools that the human carpenter employs on wood the instrument that on the london wharves cuts the veneers is a gigantic razor the tool of the shearing machine which shears iron as easily as a tailor’s scissors cut cloth is a monster pair of scissors and the steamhammer works with an ordinary hammer head but of such a weight that not thor himself could wield it these steamhammers are an invention of nasmyth and there is one that weighs over tons and strikes with a vertical fall of feet on an anvil weighing tons it is mere child’splay for it to crush a block of granite into powder yet it is no less capable of driving with a succession of light taps a nail into a piece of soft wood the implements of labour in the form of machinery necessitate the substitution of natural forces for human force and the conscious application of science instead of rule of thumb in manufacture the organisation of the social labourprocess is purely subjective it is a combination of detail labourers in its machinery system modern industry has a productive organism that is purely objective in which the labourer becomes a mere appendage to an already existing material condition of production in simple cooperation and even in that founded on division of labour the suppression of the isolated by the collective workman still appears to be more or less accidental machinery with a few exceptions to be mentioned later operates only by means of associated labour or labour in common hence the cooperative character of the labourprocess is in the latter case a technical necessity dictated by the instrument of labour itself section the value transferred by machinery to the product we saw that the productive forces resulting from cooperation and division of labour cost capital nothing they are natural forces of social labour so also physical forces like steam water c when appropriated to productive processes cost nothing but just as a man requires lungs to breathe with so he requires something that is work of man’s hand in order to consume physical forces productively a waterwheel is necessary to exploit the force of water and a steamengine to exploit the elasticity of steam once discovered the law of the deviation of the magnetic needle in the field of an electric current or the law of the magnetisation of iron around which an electric current circulates cost never a penny but the exploitation of these laws for the purposes of telegraphy c necessitates a costly and extensive apparatus the tool as we have seen is not exterminated by the machine from being a dwarf implement of the human organism it expands and multiplies into the implement of a mechanism created by man capital now sets the labourer to work not with a manual tool but with a machine which itself handles the tools although therefore it is clear at the first glance that by incorporating both stupendous physical forces and the natural sciences with the process of production modern industry raises the productiveness of labour to an extraordinary degree it is by no means equally clear that this increased productive force is not on the other hand purchased by an increased expenditure of labour machinery like every other component of constant capital creates no new value but yields up its own value to the product that it serves to beget in so far as the machine has value and in consequence parts with value to the product it forms an element in the value of that product instead of being cheapened the product is made dearer in proportion to the value of the machine and it is clear as noonday that machines and systems of machinery the characteristic instruments of labour of modern industry are incomparably more loaded with value than the implements used in handicrafts and manufactures in the first place it must be observed that the machinery while always entering as a whole into the labourprocess enters into the valuebegetting process only by bits it never adds more value than it loses on an average by wear and tear hence there is a great difference between the value of a machine and the value transferred in a given time by that machine to the product the longer the life of the machine in the labourprocess the greater is that difference it is true no doubt as we have already seen that every instrument of labour enters as a whole into the labourprocess and only piecemeal proportionally to its average daily loss by wear and tear into the valuebegetting process but this difference between the instrument as a whole and its daily wear and tear is much greater in a machine than in a tool because the machine being made from more durable material has a longer life because its employment being regulated by strictly scientific laws allows of greater economy in the wear and tear of its parts and in the materials it consumes and lastly because its field of production is incomparably larger than that of a tool after making allowance both in the case of the machine and of the tool for their average daily cost that is for the value they transmit to the product by their average daily wear and tear and for their consumption of auxiliary substance such as oil coal and so on they each do their work gratuitously just like the forces furnished by nature without the help of man the greater the productive power of the machinery compared with that of the tool the greater is the extent of its gratuitous service compared with that of the tool in modern industry man succeeded for the first time in making the product of his past labour work on a large scale gratuitously like the forces of nature in treating of cooperation and manufacture it was shown that certain general factors of production such as buildings are in comparison with the scattered means of production of the isolated workman economised by being consumed in common and that they therefore make the product cheaper in a system of machinery not only is the framework of the machine consumed in common by its numerous operating implements but the prime mover together with a part of the transmitting mechanism is consumed in common by the numerous operative machines given the difference between the value of the machinery and the value transferred by it in a day to the product the extent to which this latter value makes the product dearer depends in the first instance upon the size of the product so to say upon its area mr baynes of blackburn in a lecture published in estimates that “each real mechanical horsepower will drive selfacting mule spindles with preparation or throstle spindles or looms for inch cloth with the appliances for warping sizing c” in the first case it is the day’s produce of mule spindles in the second of throstle spindles in the third of powerlooms over which the daily cost of one horsepower and the wear and tear of the machinery set in motion by that power are spread so that only a very minute value is transferred by such wear and tear to a pound of yarn or a yard of cloth the same is the case with the steamhammer mentioned above since its daily wear and tear its coalconsumption c are spread over the stupendous masses of iron hammered by it in a day only a small value is added to a hundred weight of iron but that value would be very great if the cyclopean instrument were employed in driving in nails given a machine’s capacity for work that is the number of its operating tools or where it is a question of force their mass the amount of its product will depend on the velocity of its working parts on the speed for instance of the spindles or on the number of blows given by the hammer in a minute many of these colossal hammers strike seventy times in a minute and ryder’s patent machine for forging spindles with small hammers gives as many as strokes per minute given the rate at which machinery transfers its value to the product the amount of value so transferred depends on the total value of the machinery the less labour it contains the less value it imparts to the product the less value it gives up so much the more productive it is and so much the more its services approximate to those of natural forces but the production of machinery by machinery lessens its value relatively to its extension and efficacy an analysis and comparison of the prices of commodities produced by handicrafts or manufactures and of the prices of the same commodities produced by machinery shows generally that in the product of machinery the value due to the instruments of labour increases relatively but decreases absolutely in other words its absolute amount decreases but its amount relatively to the total value of the product of a pound of yarn for instance increases it is evident that whenever it costs as much labour to produce a machine as is saved by the employment of that machine there is nothing but a transposition of labour consequently the total labour required to produce a commodity is not lessened or the productiveness of labour is not increased it is clear however that the difference between the labour a machine costs and the labour it saves in other words that the degree of its productiveness does not depend on the difference between its own value and the value of the implement it replaces as long as the labour spent on a machine and consequently the portion of its value added to the product remains smaller than the value added by the workman to the product with his tool there is always a difference of labour saved in favour of the machine the productiveness of a machine is therefore measured by the human labourpower it replaces according to mr baynes operatives are required for the mule spindles inclusive of preparation machinery that are driven by onehorse power each selfacting mule spindle working ten hours produces ounces of yarn average number of thickness consequently ½ operatives spin weekly lbs of yarn hence leaving waste on one side lbs of cotton absorb during their conversion into yarn only hours’ labour or fifteen days’ labour of ten hours each but with a spinningwheel supposing the handspinner to produce thirteen ounces of yarn in sixty hours the same weight of cotton would absorb days’ labour of ten hours each or hours’ labour where blockprinting the old method of printing calico by hand has been superseded by machine printing a single machine prints with the aid of one man or boy as much calico of four colours in one hour as it formerly took men to do before eli whitney invented the cotton gin in the separation of the seed from a pound of cotton cost an average day’s labour by means of his invention one negress was enabled to clean lbs daily and since then the efficacy of the gin has been considerably increased a pound of cotton wool previously costing cents to produce included after that invention more unpaid labour and was consequently sold with greater profit at cents in india they employ for separating the wool from the seed an instrument half machine half tool called a churka with this one man and a woman can clean lbs daily with the churka invented some years ago by dr forbes one man and a boy produce lbs daily if oxen steam or water be used for driving it only a few boys and girls as feeders are required sixteen of these machines driven by oxen do as much work in a day as formerly people did on an average as already stated a steamplough does as much work in one hour at a cost of threepence as men at a cost of shillings i return to this example in order to clear up an erroneous notion the shillings are by no means the expression in money of all the labour expended in one hour by the men if the ratio of surplus labour to necessary labour were these men would produce in one hour a value of shillings although their wages shillings represent only their labour for half an hour suppose then a machine cost as much as the wages for a year of the men it displaces say £ this £ is by no means the expression in money of the labour added to the object produced by these men before the introduction of the machine but only of that portion of their year’s labour which was expended for themselves and represented by their wages on the other hand the £ the moneyvalue of the machine expresses all the labour expended on its production no matter in what proportion this labour constitutes wages for the workman and surplusvalue for the capitalist therefore though a machine cost as much as the labourpower displaced by it costs yet the labour materialised in it is even then much less than the living labour it replaces the use of machinery for the exclusive purpose of cheapening the product is limited in this way that less labour must be expended in producing the machinery than is displaced by the employment of that machinery for the capitalist however this use is still more limited instead of paying for the labour he only pays the value of the labourpower employed therefore the limit to his using a machine is fixed by the difference between the value of the machine and the value of the labourpower replaced by it since the division of the day’s work into necessary and surplus labour differs in different countries and even in the same country at different periods or in different branches of industry and further since the actual wage of the labourer at one time sinks below the value of his labourpower at another rises above it it is possible for the difference between the price of the machinery and the price of the labourpower replaced by that machinery to vary very much although the difference between the quantity of labour requisite to produce the machine and the total quantity replaced by it remain constant but it is the former difference alone that determines the cost to the capitalist of producing a commodity and through the pressure of competition influences his action hence the invention nowadays of machines in england that are employed only in north america just as in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries machines were invented in germany to be used only in holland and just as many a french invention of the eighteenth century was exploited in england alone in the older countries machinery when employed in some branches of industry creates such a redundancy of labour in other branches that in these latter the fall of wages below the value of labourpower impedes the use of machinery and from the standpoint of the capitalist whose profit comes not from a diminution of the labour employed but of the labour paid for renders that use superfluous and often impossible in some branches of the woollen manufacture in england the employment of children has during recent years been considerably diminished and in some cases has been entirely abolished why because the factory acts made two sets of children necessary one working six hours the other four or each working five hours but the parents refused to sell the “halftimers” cheaper than the “fulltimers” hence the substitution of machinery for the “halftimers” before the labour of women and of children under years of age was forbidden in mines capitalists considered the employment of naked women and girls often in company with men so far sanctioned by their moral code and especially by their ledgers that it was only after the passing of the act that they had recourse to machinery the yankees have invented a stonebreaking machine the english do not make use of it because the “wretch” who does this work gets paid for such a small portion of his labour that machinery would increase the cost of production to the capitalist in england women are still occasionally used instead of horses for hauling canal boats because the labour required to produce horses and machines is an accurately known quantity while that required to maintain the women of the surpluspopulation is below all calculation hence nowhere do we find a more shameful squandering of human labourpower for the most despicable purposes than in england the land of machinery section the proximate effects of machinery on the workman the startingpoint of modern industry is as we have shown the revolution in the instruments of labour and this revolution attains its most highly developed form in the organised system of machinery in a factory before we inquire how human material is incorporated with this objective organism let us consider some general effects of this revolution on the labourer himself a appropriation of supplementary labourpower by capital the employment of women and children in so far as machinery dispenses with muscular power it becomes a means of employing labourers of slight muscular strength and those whose bodily development is incomplete but whose limbs are all the more supple the labour of women and children was therefore the first thing sought for by capitalists who used machinery that mighty substitute for labour and labourers was forthwith changed into a means for increasing the number of wagelabourers by enrolling under the direct sway of capital every member of the workman’s family without distinction of age or sex compulsory work for the capitalist usurped the place not only of the children’s play but also of free labour at home within moderate limits for the support of the family the value of labourpower was determined not only by the labourtime necessary to maintain the individual adult labourer but also by that necessary to maintain his family machinery by throwing every member of that family on to the labourmarket spreads the value of the man’s labourpower over his whole family it thus depreciates his labourpower to purchase the labourpower of a family of four workers may perhaps cost more than it formerly did to purchase the labourpower of the head of the family but in return four days’ labour takes the place of one and their price falls in proportion to the excess of the surplus labour of four over the surplus labour of one in order that the family may live four people must now not only labour but expend surplus labour for the capitalist thus we see that machinery while augmenting the human material that forms the principal object of capital’s exploiting power at the same time raises the degree of exploitation machinery also revolutionises out and out the contract between the labourer and the capitalist which formally fixes their mutual relations taking the exchange of commodities as our basis our first assumption was that capitalist and labourer met as free persons as independent owners of commodities the one possessing money and means of production the other labourpower but now the capitalist buys children and young persons under age previously the workman sold his own labourpower which he disposed of nominally as a free agent now he sells wife and child he has become a slavedealer the demand for children’s labour often resembles in form the inquiries for negro slaves such as were formerly to be read among the advertisements in american journals “my attention” says an english factory inspector “was drawn to an advertisement in the local paper of one of the most important manufacturing towns of my district of which the following is a copy wanted to young persons not younger than what can pass for years wages shillings a week apply c” the phrase “what can pass for years” has reference to the fact that by the factory act children under years may work only hours a surgeon officially appointed must certify their age the manufacturer therefore asks for children who look as if they were already years old the decrease often by leaps and bounds in the number of children under years employed in factories a decrease that is shown in an astonishing manner by the english statistics of the last years was for the most part according to the evidence of the factory inspectors themselves the work of the certifying surgeons who overstated the age of the children agreeably to the capitalist’s greed for exploitation and the sordid trafficking needs of the parents in the notorious district of bethnal green a public market is held every monday and tuesday morning where children of both sexes from years of age upwards hire themselves out to the silk manufacturers the usual terms are s d a week this belongs to the parents and ‘ d for myself and tea’ the contract is binding only for the week the scene and language while this market is going on are quite disgraceful” it has also occurred in england that women have taken “children from the workhouse and let any one have them out for s d a week” in spite of legislation the number of boys sold in great britain by their parents to act as live chimneysweeping machines although there exist plenty of machines to replace them exceeds the revolution effected by machinery in the juridical relations between the buyer and the seller of labourpower causing the transaction as a whole to lose the appearance of a contract between free persons afforded the english parliament an excuse founded on juridical principles for the interference of the state with factories whenever the law limits the labour of children to hours in industries not before interfered with the complaints of the manufacturers are always renewed they allege that numbers of the parents withdraw their children from the industry brought under the act in order to sell them where “freedom of labour” still rules ie where children under years are compelled to work like grownup people and therefore can be got rid of at a higher price but since capital is by nature a leveller since it exacts in every sphere of production equality in the conditions of the exploitation of labour the limitation by law of children’s labour in one branch of industry becomes the cause of its limitation in others we have already alluded to the physical deterioration as well of the children and youngpersons as of the women whom machinery first directly in the factories that shoot up on its basis and then indirectly in all the remaining branches of industry subjects to the exploitation of capital in this place therefore we dwell only on one point the enormous mortality during the first few years of their life of the children of the operatives in sixteen of the registration districts into which england is divided there are for every children alive under the age of one year only deaths in a year on an average in one district only in districts the deaths are over but under in districts over but under in districts over but under in districts over in districts over in over in over in hoo wolverhampton ashtonunderlyne and preston over in nottingham stockport and bradford over in wisbeach and in manchester as was shown by an official medical inquiry in the year the high deathrates are apart from local causes principally due to the employment of the mothers away from their homes and to the neglect and maltreatment consequent on her absence such as amongst others insufficient nourishment unsuitable food and dosing with opiates besides this there arises an unnatural estrangement between mother and child and as a consequence intentional starving and poisoning of the children in those agricultural districts “where a minimum in the employment of women exists the deathrate is on the other hand very low” the inquiry commission of led however to the unexpected result that in some purely agricultural districts bordering on the north sea the deathrate of children under one year old almost equalled that of the worst factory districts dr julian hunter was therefore commissioned to investigate this phenomenon on the spot his report is incorporated with the “sixth report on public health” up to that time it was supposed that the children were decimated by malaria and other diseases peculiar to lowlying and marshy districts but the inquiry showed the very opposite namely that the same cause which drove away malaria the conversion of the land from a morass in winter and a scanty pasture in summer into fruitful corn land created the exceptional deathrate of the infants the medical men whom dr hunter examined in that district were “wonderfully in accord” on this point in fact the revolution in the mode of cultivation had led to the introduction of the industrial system married women who work in gangs along with boys and girls are for a stipulated sum of money placed at the disposal of the farmer by a man called the “undertaker” who contracts for the whole gang “these gangs will sometimes travel many miles from their own village they are to be met morning and evening on the roads dressed in short petticoats with suitable coats and boots and sometimes trousers looking wonderfully strong and healthy but tainted with a customary immorality and heedless of the fatal results which their love of this busy and independent life is bringing on their unfortunate offspring who are pining at home” every phenomenon of the factory districts is here reproduced including but to a greater extent illdisguised infanticide and dosing children with opiates “my knowledge of such evils” says dr simon the medical officer of the privy council and editor in chief of the reports on public health “may excuse the profound misgiving with which i regard any large industrial employment of adult women” “happy indeed” exclaims mr baker the factory inspector in his official report “happy indeed will it be for the manufacturing districts of england when every married woman having a family is prohibited from working in any textile works at all” the moral degradation caused by the capitalistic exploitation of women and children has been so exhaustively depicted by f engels in his “lage der arbeitenden klasse englands” and other writers that i need only mention the subject in this place but the intellectual desolation artificially produced by converting immature human beings into mere machines for the fabrication of surplusvalue a state of mind clearly distinguishable from that natural ignorance which keeps the mind fallow without destroying its capacity for development its natural fertility this desolation finally compelled even the english parliament to make elementary education a compulsory condition to the “productive” employment of children under years in every industry subject to the factory acts the spirit of capitalist production stands out clearly in the ludicrous wording of the socalled education clauses in the factory acts in the absence of an administrative machinery an absence that again makes the compulsion illusory in the opposition of the manufacturers themselves to these education clauses and in the tricks and dodges they put in practice for evading them “for this the legislature is alone to blame by having passed a delusive law which while it would seem to provide that the children employed in factories shall be educated contains no enactment by which that professed end can be secured it provides nothing more than that the children shall on certain days of the week and for a certain number of hours three in each day be inclosed within the four walls of a place called a school and that the employer of the child shall receive weekly a certificate to that effect signed by a person designated by the subscriber as a schoolmaster or schoolmistress” previous to the passing of the amended factory act it happened not unfrequently that the certificates of attendance at school were signed by the schoolmaster or schoolmistress with a cross as they themselves were unable to write “on one occasion on visiting a place called a school from which certificates of school attendance had issued i was so struck with the ignorance of the master that i said to him ‘pray sir can you read’ his reply was ‘aye summat’ and as a justification of his right to grant certificates he added ‘at any rate i am before my scholars’” the inspectors when the bill of was in preparation did not fail to represent the disgraceful state of the places called schools certificates from which they were obliged to admit as a compliance with the laws but they were successful only in obtaining thus much that since the passing of the act of the figures in the school certificate must be filled up in the handwriting of the schoolmaster who must also sign his christian and surname in full” sir john kincaid factory inspector for scotland relates experiences of the same kind “the first school we visited was kept by a mrs ann killin upon asking her to spell her name she straightway made a mistake by beginning with the letter c but correcting herself immediately she said her name began with a k on looking at her signature however in the school certificate books i noticed that she spelt it in various ways while her handwriting left no doubt as to her unfitness to teach she herself also acknowledged that she could not keep the register in a second school i found the schoolroom feet long and feet wide and counted in this space children who were gabbling something unintelligible” but it is not only in the miserable places above referred to that the children obtain certificates of school attendance without having received instruction of any value for in many schools where there is a competent teacher his efforts are of little avail from the distracting crowd of children of all ages from infants of years old and upwards his livelihood miserable at the best depending on the pence received from the greatest number of children whom it is possible to cram into the space to this is to be added scanty school furniture deficiency of books and other materials for teaching and the depressing effect upon the poor children themselves of a close noisome atmosphere i have been in many such schools where i have seen rows of children doing absolutely nothing and this is certified as school attendance and in statistical returns such children are set down as being educated” in scotland the manufacturers try all they can to do without the children that are obliged to attend school “it requires no further argument to prove that the educational clauses of the factory act being held in such disfavour among millowners tend in a great measure to exclude that class of children alike from the employment and the benefit of education contemplated by this act” horribly grotesque does this appear in print works which are regulated by a special act by that act “every child before being employed in a print work must have attended school for at least days and not less than hours during the six months immediately preceding such first day of employment and during the continuance of its employment in the print works it must attend for a like period of days and hours during every successive period of six months the attendance at school must be between am and pm no attendance of less than ½ hours nor more than hours on any one day shall be reckoned as part of the hours under ordinary circumstances the children attend school morning and afternoon for days for at least hours each day and upon the expiration of the days the statutory total of hours having been attained having in their language made up their book they return to the print work where they continue until the six months have expired when another instalment of school attendance becomes due and they again seek the school until the book is again made up many boys having attended school for the required number of hours when they return to school after the expiration of their six months’ work in the print work are in the same condition as when they first attended school as printwork boys that they have lost all they gained by their previous school attendance in other print works the children’s attendance at school is made to depend altogether upon the exigencies of the work in the establishment the requisite number of hours is made up each six months by instalments consisting of from to hours at a time spreading over perhaps the whole six months for instance the attendance on one day might be from to am on another day from pm to pm and the child might not appear at school again for several days when it would attend from pm to pm then it might attend for or days consecutively or for a week then it would not appear in school for weeks or a month after that upon some odd days at some odd hours when the operative who employed it chose to spare it and thus the child was as it were buffeted from school to work from work to school until the tale of hours was told” by the excessive addition of women and children to the ranks of the workers machinery at last breaks down the resistance which the male operatives in the manufacturing period continued to oppose to the despotism of capital b prolongation of the working day if machinery be the most powerful means for increasing the productiveness of labour – ie for shortening the workingtime required in the production of a commodity it becomes in the hands of capital the most powerful means in those industries first invaded by it for lengthening the working day beyond all bounds set by human nature it creates on the one hand new conditions by which capital is enabled to give free scope to this its constant tendency and on the other hand new motives with which to whet capital’s appetite for the labour of others in the first place in the form of machinery the implements of labour become automatic things moving and working independent of the workman they are thenceforth an industrial perpetuum mobile that would go on producing forever did it not meet with certain natural obstructions in the weak bodies and the strong wills of its human attendants the automaton as capital and because it is capital is endowed in the person of the capitalist with intelligence and will it is therefore animated by the longing to reduce to a minimum the resistance offered by that repellent yet elastic natural barrier man this resistance is moreover lessened by the apparent lightness of machine work and by the more pliant and docile character of the women and children employed on it the productiveness of machinery is as we saw inversely proportional to the value transferred by it to the product the longer the life of the machine the greater is the mass of the products over which the value transmitted by the machine is spread and the less is the portion of that value added to each single commodity the active lifetime of a machine is however clearly dependent on the length of the working day or on the duration of the daily labourprocess multiplied by the number of days for which the process is carried on the wear and tear of a machine is not exactly proportional to its workingtime and even if it were so a machine working hours daily for ½ years covers as long a working period as and transmits to the total product no more value than the same machine would if it worked only hours daily for years but in the first case the value of the machine would be reproduced twice as quickly as in the latter and the capitalist would by this use of the machine absorb in ½ years as much surplusvalue as in the second case he would in the material wear and tear of a machine is of two kinds the one arises from use as coins wear away by circulating the other from nonuse as a sword rusts when left in its scabbard the latter kind is due to the elements the former is more or less directly proportional the latter to a certain extent inversely proportional to the use of the machine but in addition to the material wear and tear a machine also undergoes what we may call a moral depreciation it loses exchangevalue either by machines of the same sort being produced cheaper than it or by better machines entering into competition with it in both cases be the machine ever so young and full of life its value is no longer determined by the labour actually materialised in it but by the labourtime requisite to reproduce either it or the better machine it has therefore lost value more or less the shorter the period taken to reproduce its total value the less is the danger of moral depreciation and the longer the working day the shorter is that period when machinery is first introduced into an industry new methods of reproducing it more cheaply follow blow upon blow and so do improvements that not only affect individual parts and details of the machine but its entire build it is therefore in the early days of the life of machinery that this special incentive to the prolongation of the working day makes itself felt most acutely given the length of the working day all other circumstances remaining the same the exploitation of double the number of workmen demands not only a doubling of that part of constant capital which is invested in machinery and buildings but also of that part which is laid out in raw material and auxiliary substances the lengthening of the working day on the other hand allows of production on an extended scale without any alteration in the amount of capital laid out on machinery and buildings not only is there therefore an increase of surplusvalue but the outlay necessary to obtain it diminishes it is true that this takes place more or less with every lengthening of the working day but in the case under consideration the change is more marked because the capital converted into the instruments of labour preponderates to a greater degree the development of the factory system fixes a constantly increasing portion of the capital in a form in which on the one hand its value is capable of continual selfexpansion and in which on the other hand it loses both usevalue and exchangevalue whenever it loses contact with living labour “when a labourer” said mr ashworth a cotton magnate to professor nassau w senior “lays down his spade he renders useless for that period a capital worth eighteenpence when one of our people leaves the mill he renders useless a capital that has cost £ ” only fancy making “useless” for a single moment a capital that has cost £ it is in truth monstrous that a single one of our people should ever leave the factory the increased use of machinery as senior after the instruction he received from ashworth clearly perceives makes a constantly increasing lengthening of the working day “desirable” machinery produces relative surplusvalue not only by directly depreciating the value of labourpower and by indirectly cheapening the same through cheapening the commodities that enter into its reproduction but also when it is first introduced sporadically into an industry by converting the labour employed by the owner of that machinery into labour of a higher degree and greater efficacy by raising the social value of the article produced above its individual value and thus enabling the capitalist to replace the value of a day’s labourpower by a smaller portion of the value of a day’s product during this transition period when the use of machinery is a sort of monopoly the profits are therefore exceptional and the capitalist endeavours to exploit thoroughly “the sunny time of this his first love” by prolonging the working day as much as possible the magnitude of the profit whets his appetite for more profit as the use of machinery becomes more general in a particular industry the social value of the product sinks down to its individual value and the law that surplusvalue does not arise from the labourpower that has been replaced by the machinery but from the labourpower actually employed in working with the machinery asserts itself surplusvalue arises from variable capital alone and we saw that the amount of surplusvalue depends on two factors viz the rate of surplusvalue and the number of the workmen simultaneously employed given the length of the working day the rate of surplusvalue is determined by the relative duration of the necessary labour and of the surplus labour in a day the number of the labourers simultaneously employed depends on its side on the ratio of the variable to the constant capital now however much the use of machinery may increase the surplus labour at the expense of the necessary labour by heightening the productiveness of labour it is clear that it attains this result only by diminishing the number of workmen employed by a given amount of capital it converts what was formerly variable capital invested in labourpower into machinery which being constant capital does not produce surplusvalue it is impossible for instance to squeeze as much surplusvalue out of as out of labourers if each of these men gives only one hour of surplus labour in the men give together hours of surplus labour while hours is the total labour of the two men hence the application of machinery to the production of surplusvalue implies a contradiction which is immanent in it since of the two factors of the surplusvalue created by a given amount of capital one the rate of surplusvalue cannot be increased except by diminishing the other the number of workmen this contradiction comes to light as soon as by the general employment of machinery in a given industry the value of the machineproduced commodity regulates the value of all commodities of the same sort and it is this contradiction that in its turn drives the capitalist without his being conscious of the fact to excessive lengthening of the working day in order that he may compensate the decrease in the relative number of labourers exploited by an increase not only of the relative but of the absolute surplus labour if then the capitalistic employment of machinery on the one hand supplies new and powerful motives to an excessive lengthening of the working day and radically changes as well the methods of labour as also the character of the social working organism in such a manner as to break down all opposition to this tendency on the other hand it produces partly by opening out to the capitalist new strata of the workingclass previously inaccessible to him partly by setting free the labourers it supplants a surplus working population which is compelled to submit to the dictation of capital hence that remarkable phenomenon in the history of modern industry that machinery sweeps away every moral and natural restriction on the length of the working day hence too the economic paradox that the most powerful instrument for shortening labourtime becomes the most unfailing means for placing every moment of the labourer’s time and that of his family at the disposal of the capitalist for the purpose of expanding the value of his capital “if” dreamed aristotle the greatest thinker of antiquity “if every tool when summoned or even of its own accord could do the work that befits it just as the creations of daedalus moved of themselves or the tripods of hephaestos went of their own accord to their sacred work if the weavers’ shuttles were to weave of themselves then there would be no need either of apprentices for the master workers or of slaves for the lords” and antipatros a greek poet of the time of cicero hailed the invention of the waterwheel for grinding corn an invention that is the elementary form of all machinery as the giver of freedom to female slaves and the bringer back of the golden age oh those heathens they understood as the learned bastiat and before him the still wiser macculloch have discovered nothing of political economy and christianity they did not for example comprehend that machinery is the surest means of lengthening the working day they perhaps excused the slavery of one on the ground that it was a means to the full development of another but to preach slavery of the masses in order that a few crude and halfeducated parvenus might become “eminent spinners” “extensive sausagemakers” and “influential shoeblack dealers” to do this they lacked the bump of christianity c intensification of labour the immoderate lengthening of the working day produced by machinery in the hands of capital leads to a reaction on the part of society the very sources of whose life are menaced and thence to a normal working day whose length is fixed by law thenceforth a phenomenon that we have already met with namely the intensification of labour develops into great importance our analysis of absolute surplusvalue had reference primarily to the extension or duration of the labour its intensity being assumed as given we now proceed to consider the substitution of a more intensified labour for labour of more extensive duration and the degree of the former it is selfevident that in proportion as the use of machinery spreads and the experience of a special class of workmen habituated to machinery accumulates the rapidity and intensity of labour increase as a natural consequence thus in england during half a century lengthening of the working day went hand in hand with increasing intensity of factory labour nevertheless the reader will clearly see that where we have labour not carried on by fits and starts but repeated day after day with unvarying uniformity a point must inevitably be reached where extension of the working day and intensity of the labour mutually exclude one another in such a way that lengthening of the working day becomes compatible only with a lower degree of intensity and a higher degree of intensity only with a shortening of the working day so soon as the gradually surging revolt of the workingclass compelled parliament to shorten compulsorily the hours of labour and to begin by imposing a normal working day on factories proper so soon consequently as an increased production of surplusvalue by the prolongation of the working day was once for all put a stop to from that moment capital threw itself with all its might into the production of relative surplusvalue by hastening on the further improvement of machinery at the same time a change took place in the nature of relative surplusvalue generally speaking the mode of producing relative surplusvalue consists in raising the productive power of the workman so as to enable him to produce more in a given time with the same expenditure of labour labourtime continues to transmit as before the same value to the total product but this unchanged amount of exchangevalue is spread over more usevalue hence the value of each single commodity sinks otherwise however so soon as the compulsory shortening of the hours of labour takes place the immense impetus it gives the development of productive power and to economy in the means of production imposes on the workman increased expenditure of labour in a given time heightened tension of labourpower and closer filling up of the pores of the working day or condensation of labour to a degree that is attainable only within the limits of the shortened working day this condensation of a greater mass of labour into a given period thenceforward counts for what it really is a greater quantity of labour in addition to a measure of its extension ie duration labour now acquires a measure of its intensity or of the degree of its condensation or density the denser hour of the ten hours’ working day contains more labour ie expended labourpower than the more porous hour of the twelve hours’ working day the product therefore of one of the former hours has as much or more value than has the product of of the latter hours apart from the increased yield of relative surplusvalue through the heightened productiveness of labour the same mass of value is now produced for the capitalist say by hours of surplus labour and hours of necessary labour as was previously produced by four hours of surplus labour and eight hours of necessary labour we now come to the question how is the labour intensified the first effect of shortening the working day results from the selfevident law that the efficiency of labourpower is in an inverse ratio to the duration of its expenditure hence within certain limits what is lost by shortening the duration is gained by the increasing tension of labourpower that the workman moreover really does expend more labourpower is ensured by the mode in which the capitalist pays him in those industries such as potteries where machinery plays little or no part the introduction of the factory acts has strikingly shown that the mere shortening of the working day increases to a wonderful degree the regularity uniformity order continuity and energy of the labour it seemed however doubtful whether this effect was produced in the factory proper where the dependence of the workman on the continuous and uniform motion of the machinery had already created the strictest discipline hence when in the reduction of the working day to less than twelve hours was being debated the masters almost unanimously declared “that their overlookers in the different rooms took good care that the hands lost no time” that “the extent of vigilance and attention on the part of the workmen was hardly capable of being increased” and therefore that the speed of the machinery and other conditions remaining unaltered “to expect in a wellmanaged factory any important result from increased attention of the workmen was an absurdity” this assertion was contradicted by experiments mr robert gardner reduced the hours of labour in his two large factories at preston on and after the th april from twelve to eleven hours a day the result of about a year’s working was that “the same amount of product for the same cost was received and the workpeople as a whole earned in eleven hours as much wages as they did before in twelve” i pass over the experiments made in the spinning and carding rooms because they were accompanied by an increase of in the speed of the machines but in the weaving department where moreover many sorts of figured fancy articles were woven there was not the slightest alteration in the conditions of the work the result was “from th january to th april with a twelve hours’ day average weekly wages of each hand s ½d from th april to th june with day of eleven hours average weekly wages s ½d” here we have more produced in eleven hours than previously in twelve and entirely in consequence of more steady application and economy of time by the workpeople while they got the same wages and gained one hour of spare time the capitalist got the same amount produced and saved the cost of coal gas and other such items for one hour similar experiments and with the like success were carried out in the mills of messrs horrocks and jacson the shortening of the hours of labour creates to begin with the subjective conditions for the condensation of labour by enabling the workman to exert more strength in a given time so soon as that shortening becomes compulsory machinery becomes in the hands of capital the objective means systematically employed for squeezing out more labour in a given time this is effected in two ways by increasing the speed of the machinery and by giving the workman more machinery to tent improved construction of the machinery is necessary partly because without it greater pressure cannot be put on the workman and partly because the shortened hours of labour force the capitalist to exercise the strictest watch over the cost of production the improvements in the steamengine have increased the piston speed and at the same time have made it possible by means of a greater economy of power to drive with the same or even a smaller consumption of coal more machinery with the same engine the improvements in the transmitting mechanism have lessened friction and what so strikingly distinguishes modern from the older machinery have reduced the diameter and weight of the shafting to a constantly decreasing minimum finally the improvements in the operative machines have while reducing their size increased their speed and efficiency as in the modern powerloom or while increasing the size of their framework have also increased the extent and number of their working parts as in spinningmules or have added to the speed of these working parts by imperceptible alterations of detail such as those which ten years ago increased the speed of the spindles in selfacting mules by onefifth the reduction of the working day to hours dates in england from in a manufacturer stated “the labour now undergone in the factories is much greater than it used to be compared with thirty or forty years ago owing to the greater attention and activity required by the greatly increased speed which is given to the machinery” in the year lord ashley now lord shaftesbury made in the house of commons the following statements supported by documentary evidence “the labour performed by those engaged in the processes of manufacture is three times as great as in the beginning of such operations machinery has executed no doubt the work that would demand the sinews of millions of men but it has also prodigiously multiplied the labour of those who are governed by its fearful movements in the labour of following a pair of mules spinning cotton of no – reckoning hours to the working day – involved a necessity of walking miles in the distance travelled in following a pair of mules spinning cotton yarn of the same number was miles and frequently more in ” query – or “the spinner put up daily on each of these mules stretches making a total of stretches in the course of the day in the spinner put up on each mule stretches making a total of in stretches making a total of and in some cases the amount of labour required is even still greater i have another document sent to me in stating that the labour is progressively increasing increasing not only because the distance to be travelled is greater but because the quantity of goods produced is multiplied while the hands are fewer in proportion than before and moreover because an inferior species of cotton is now often spun which it is more difficult to work in the cardingroom there has also been a great increase of labour one person there does the work formerly divided between two in the weavingroom where a vast number of persons are employed and principally females the labour has increased within the last few years fully per cent owing to the increased speed of the machinery in spinning in the number of hanks spun per week was in it amounted to in the number of picks in powerloomweaving per minute was – in it was showing a vast increase of labour” in the face of this remarkable intensity of labour which had already been reached in under the twelve hours’ act there appeared to be a justification for the assertion made at that time by the english manufacturers that any further progress in that direction was impossible and therefore that every further reduction of the hours of labour meant a lessened production the apparent correctness of their reasons will be best shown by the following contemporary statement by leonard horner the factory inspector their ever watchful censor “now as the quantity produced must in the main be regulated by the speed of the machinery it must be the interest of the millowner to drive it at the utmost rate of speed consistent with these following conditions viz the preservation of the machinery from too rapid deterioration the preservation of the quality of the article manufactured and the capability of the workman to follow the motion without a greater exertion than he can sustain for a constancy one of the most important problems therefore which the owner of a factory has to solve is to find out the maximum speed at which he can run with a due regard to the above conditions it frequently happens that he finds he has gone too fast that breakages and bad work more than counterbalance the increased speed and that he is obliged to slacken his pace i therefore concluded that as an active and intelligent millowner would find out the safe maximum it would not be possible to produce as much in eleven hours as in twelve i further assumed that the operative paid by piecework would exert himself to the utmost consistent with the power of continuing at the same rate” horner therefore came to the conclusion that a reduction of the working hours below twelve would necessarily diminish production he himself ten years later cites his opinion of in proof of how much he underestimated in that year the elasticity of machinery and of man’s labourpower both of which are simultaneously stretched to an extreme by the compulsory shortening of the working day we now come to the period that follows the introduction of the ten hours’ act in into the english cotton woollen silk and flax mills “the speed of the spindles has increased upon throstles and upon mules revolutions a minute ie the speed of the throstle spindle which in was times a minute is now and of the mule spindle that was is now times a minute amounting in the former case to onetenth and in the second case to onefifth additional increase” james nasmyth the eminent civil engineer of patricroft near manchester explained in a letter to leonard horner written in the nature of the improvements in the steamengine that had been made between the years and after remarking that the horsepower of steamengines being always estimated in the official returns according to the power of similar engines in is only nominal and can serve only as an index of their real power he goes on to say “i am confident that from the same weight of steamengine machinery we are now obtaining at least per cent more duty or work performed on the average and that in many cases the identical steamengines which in the days of the restricted speed of feet per minute yielded horsepower are now yielding upwards of ” the modern steamengine of horsepower is capable of being driven at a much greater force than formerly arising from improvements in its construction the capacity and construction of the boilers c” “although the same number of hands are employed in proportion to the horsepower as at former periods there are fewer hands employed in proportion to the machinery” “in the year the factories of the united kingdom employed nominal horsepower to give motion to spindles and looms the number of spindles and looms in was respectively of the former and of the latter which reckoning the force of the nominal horsepower required to be the same as in would require a force equal to horses but the actual power given in the return for is less by above horses than calculating upon the basis of the return of the factories ought to have required in ” “the facts thus brought out by the return of appear to be that the factory system is increasing rapidly that although the same number of hands are employed in proportion to the horsepower as at former periods there are fewer hands employed in proportion to the machinery that the steamengine is enabled to drive an increased weight of machinery by economy of force and other methods and that an increased quantity of work can be turned off by improvements in machinery and in methods of manufacture by increase of speed of the machinery and by a variety of other causes” “the great improvements made in machines of every kind have raised their productive power very much without any doubt the shortening of the hours of labour gave the impulse to these improvements the latter combined with the more intense strain on the workman have had the effect that at least as much is produced in the shortened by two hours or onesixth working day as was previously produced during the longer one” one fact is sufficient to show how greatly the wealth of the manufacturers increased along with the more intense exploitation of labourpower from to the average proportional increase in english cotton and other factories was while from to it amounted to but however great the progress of english industry had been during the years from to under the influence of a working day of hours it was far surpassed during the next period of years from to in silk factories for instance there were in spindles in in looms in but the number of operatives was in in the increase in the spindles was therefore and in the looms while the number of the operatives decreased in the year there were employed in worsted mills spindles in increase and in decrease but if we deduct the doubling spindles that figure in the numbers for but not in those for it will be found that after the number of spindles remained nearly stationary on the other hand after the speed of the spindles and looms was in many cases doubled the number of powerlooms in worsted mills was in in in the number of the operatives was in in in included in these however the children under years of age were in in in in spite therefore of the greatly increased number of looms in compared with the total number of the workpeople employed decreased and that of the children exploited increased on the th april mr ferrand said in the house of commons “i have been informed by delegates from districts of lancashire and cheshire in whose behalf i speak that the work in the factories is in consequence of the improvements in machinery constantly on the increase instead of as formerly one person with two helps tenting two looms one person now tents three looms without helps and it is no uncommon thing for one person to tent four twelve hours’ work as is evident from the facts adduced is now compressed into less than hours it is therefore selfevident to what an enormous extent the toil of the factory operative has increased during the last years” although therefore the factory inspectors unceasingly and with justice commend the results of the acts of and yet they admit that the shortening of the hours of labour has already called forth such an intensification of the labour as is injurious to the health of the workman and to his capacity for work “in most of the cotton worsted and silk mills an exhausting state of excitement necessary to enable the workers satisfactorily to mind the machinery the motion of which has been greatly accelerated within the last few years seems to me not unlikely to be one of the causes of that excess of mortality from lung disease which dr greenhow has pointed out in his recent report on this subject” there cannot be the slightest doubt that the tendency that urges capital so soon as a prolongation of the hours of labour is once for all forbidden to compensate itself by a systematic heightening of the intensity of labour and to convert every improvement in machinery into a more perfect means of exhausting the workman must soon lead to a state of things in which a reduction of the hours of labour will again be inevitable on the other hand the rapid advance of english industry between and the present time under the influence of a day of hours surpasses the advance made between and when the day was hours long by far more than the latter surpasses the advance made during the half century after the first introduction of the factory system when the working day was without limits section the factory at the commencement of this chapter we considered that which we may call the body of the factory ie machinery organised into a system we there saw how machinery by annexing the labour of women and children augments the number of human beings who form the material for capitalistic exploitation how it confiscates the whole of the workman’s disposable time by immoderate extension of the hours of labour and how finally its progress which allows of enormous increase of production in shorter and shorter periods serves as a means of systematically getting more work done in a shorter time or of exploiting labourpower more intensely we now turn to the factory as a whole and that in its most perfect form dr ure the pindar of the automatic factory describes it on the one hand as “combined cooperation of many orders of workpeople adult and young in tending with assiduous skill a system of productive machines continuously impelled by a central power” the prime mover on the other hand as “a vast automaton composed of various mechanical and intellectual organs acting in uninterrupted concert for the production of a common object all of them being subordinate to a selfregulated moving force” these two descriptions are far from being identical in one the collective labourer or social body of labour appears as the dominant subject and the mechanical automaton as the object in the other the automaton itself is the subject and the workmen are merely conscious organs coordinate with the unconscious organs of the automaton and together with them subordinated to the central movingpower the first description is applicable to every possible employment of machinery on a large scale the second is characteristic of its use by capital and therefore of the modern factory system ure prefers therefore to describe the central machine from which the motion comes not only as an automaton but as an autocrat “in these spacious halls the benignant power of steam summons around him his myriads of willing menials” along with the tool the skill of the workman in handling it passes over to the machine the capabilities of the tool are emancipated from the restraints that are inseparable from human labourpower thereby the technical foundation on which is based the division of labour in manufacture is swept away hence in the place of the hierarchy of specialised workmen that characterises manufacture there steps in the automatic factory a tendency to equalise and reduce to one and the same level every kind of work that has to be done by the minders of the machines in the place of the artificially produced differentiations of the detail workmen step the natural differences of age and sex so far as division of labour reappears in the factory it is primarily a distribution of the workmen among the specialised machines and of masses of workmen not however organised into groups among the various departments of the factory in each of which they work at a number of similar machines placed together their cooperation therefore is only simple the organised group peculiar to manufacture is replaced by the connexion between the head workman and his few assistants the essential division is into workmen who are actually employed on the machines among whom are included a few who look after the engine and into mere attendants almost exclusively children of these workmen among the attendants are reckoned more or less all “feeders” who supply the machines with the material to be worked in addition to these two principal classes there is a numerically unimportant class of persons whose occupation it is to look after the whole of the machinery and repair it from time to time such as engineers mechanics joiners c this is a superior class of workmen some of them scientifically educated others brought up to a trade it is distinct from the factory operative class and merely aggregated to it this division of labour is purely technical to work at a machine the workman should be taught from childhood in order that he may learn to adapt his own movements to the uniform and unceasing motion of an automaton when the machinery as a whole forms a system of manifold machines working simultaneously and in concert the cooperation based upon it requires the distribution of various groups of workmen among the different kinds of machines but the employment of machinery does away with the necessity of crystallising this distribution after the manner of manufacture by the constant annexation of a particular man to a particular function since the motion of the whole system does not proceed from the workman but from the machinery a change of persons can take place at any time without an interruption of the work the most striking proof of this is afforded by the relays system put into operation by the manufacturers during their revolt from lastly the quickness with which machine work is learnt by young people does away with the necessity of bringing up for exclusive employment by machinery a special class of operatives with regard to the work of the mere attendants it can to some extent be replaced in the mill by machines and owing to its extreme simplicity it allows of a rapid and constant change of the individuals burdened with this drudgery although then technically speaking the old system of division of labour is thrown overboard by machinery it hangs on in the factory as a traditional habit handed down from manufacture and is afterwards systematically remoulded and established in a more hideous form by capital as a means of exploiting labourpower the lifelong speciality of handling one and the same tool now becomes the lifelong speciality of serving one and the same machine machinery is put to a wrong use with the object of transforming the workman from his very childhood into a part of a detailmachine in this way not only are the expenses of his reproduction considerably lessened but at the same time his helpless dependence upon the factory as a whole and therefore upon the capitalist is rendered complete here as everywhere else we must distinguish between the increased productiveness due to the development of the social process of production and that due to the capitalist exploitation of that process in handicrafts and manufacture the workman makes use of a tool in the factory the machine makes use of him there the movements of the instrument of labour proceed from him here it is the movements of the machine that he must follow in manufacture the workmen are parts of a living mechanism in the factory we have a lifeless mechanism independent of the workman who becomes its mere living appendage “the miserable routine of endless drudgery and toil in which the same mechanical process is gone through over and over again is like the labour of sisyphus the burden of labour like the rock keeps ever falling back on the wornout labourer” at the same time that factory work exhausts the nervous system to the uttermost it does away with the manysided play of the muscles and confiscates every atom of freedom both in bodily and intellectual activity the lightening of the labour even becomes a sort of torture since the machine does not free the labourer from work but deprives the work of all interest every kind of capitalist production in so far as it is not only a labourprocess but also a process of creating surplusvalue has this in common that it is not the workman that employs the instruments of labour but the instruments of labour that employ the workman but it is only in the factory system that this inversion for the first time acquires technical and palpable reality by means of its conversion into an automaton the instrument of labour confronts the labourer during the labourprocess in the shape of capital of dead labour that dominates and pumps dry living labourpower the separation of the intellectual powers of production from the manual labour and the conversion of those powers into the might of capital over labour is as we have already shown finally completed by modern industry erected on the foundation of machinery the special skill of each individual insignificant factory operative vanishes as an infinitesimal quantity before the science the gigantic physical forces and the mass of labour that are embodied in the factory mechanism and together with that mechanism constitute the power of the “master” this “master” therefore in whose brain the machinery and his monopoly of it are inseparably united whenever he falls out with his “hands” contemptuously tells them “the factory operatives should keep in wholesome remembrance the fact that theirs is really a low species of skilled labour and that there is none which is more easily acquired or of its quality more amply remunerated or which by a short training of the least expert can be more quickly as well as abundantly acquired the master’s machinery really plays a far more important part in the business of production than the labour and the skill of the operative which six months’ education can teach and a common labourer can learn” the technical subordination of the workman to the uniform motion of the instruments of labour and the peculiar composition of the body of workpeople consisting as it does of individuals of both sexes and of all ages give rise to a barrack discipline which is elaborated into a complete system in the factory and which fully develops the before mentioned labour of overlooking thereby dividing the workpeople into operatives and overlookers into private soldiers and sergeants of an industrial army “the main difficulty in the automatic factory lay above all in training human beings to renounce their desultory habits of work and to identify themselves with the unvarying regularity of the complex automaton to devise and administer a successful code of factory discipline suited to the necessities of factory diligence was the herculean enterprise the noble achievement of arkwright even at the present day when the system is perfectly organised and its labour lightened to the utmost it is found nearly impossible to convert persons past the age of puberty into useful factory hands” the factory code in which capital formulates like a private legislator and at his own good will his autocracy over his workpeople unaccompanied by that division of responsibility in other matters so much approved of by the bourgeoisie and unaccompanied by the still more approved representative system this code is but the capitalistic caricature of that social regulation of the labourprocess which becomes requisite in cooperation on a great scale and in the employment in common of instruments of labour and especially of machinery the place of the slavedriver’s lash is taken by the overlooker’s book of penalties all punishments naturally resolve themselves into fines and deductions from wages and the lawgiving talent of the factory lycurgus so arranges matters that a violation of his laws is if possible more profitable to him than the keeping of them we shall here merely allude to the material conditions under which factory labour is carried on every organ of sense is injured in an equal degree by artificial elevation of the temperature by the dustladen atmosphere by the deafening noise not to mention danger to life and limb among the thickly crowded machinery which with the regularity of the seasons issues its list of the killed and wounded in the industrial battle economy of the social means of production matured and forced as in a hothouse by the factory system is turned in the hands of capital into systematic robbery of what is necessary for the life of the workman while he is at work robbery of space light air and of protection to his person against the dangerous and unwholesome accompaniments of the productive process not to mention the robbery of appliances for the comfort of the workman is fourier wrong when he calls factories “tempered bagnos section the strife between workman and machine the contest between the capitalist and the wagelabourer dates back to the very origin of capital it raged on throughout the whole manufacturing period but only since the introduction of machinery has the workman fought against the instrument of labour itself the material embodiment of capital he revolts against this particular form of the means of production as being the material basis of the capitalist mode of production in the th century nearly all europe experienced revolts of the workpeople against the ribbonloom a machine for weaving ribbons and trimmings called in germany bandmühle schnurmühle and mühlenstuhl these machines were invented in germany abbé lancellotti in a work that appeared in venice in but which was written in says as follows “anthony müller of danzig saw about years ago in that town a very ingenious machine which weaves to pieces at once but the mayor being apprehensive that this invention might throw a large number of workmen on the streets caused the inventor to be secretly strangled or drowned” in leyden this machine was not used till there the riots of the ribbonweavers at length compelled the town council to prohibit it “in hac urbe” says boxhorn inst pol referring to the introduction of this machine into leyden “ante hos viginti circiter annos instrumentum quidam invenerunt textorium quo solus plus panni et facilius conficere poterat quan plures aequali tempore hinc turbae ortae et querulae textorum tandemque usus hujus instrumenti a magistratu prohibitus est” in this town about twenty years ago certain people invented an instrument for weaving with which a single person could weave more cloth and more easily than many others in the same length of time as a result there arose disturbances and complaints from the weavers until the town council finally prohibited the use of this instrument after making various decrees more or less prohibitive against this loom in c the states general of holland at length permitted it to be used under certain conditions by the decree of the th december it was also prohibited in cologne in at the same time that its introduction into england was causing disturbances among the workpeople by an imperial edict of th feb its use was forbidden throughout all germany in hamburg it was burnt in public by order of the senate the emperor charles vi on th feb renewed the edict of and not till was its use openly allowed in the electorate of saxony this machine which shook europe to its foundations was in fact the precursor of the mule and the powerloom and of the industrial revolution of the th century it enabled a totally inexperienced boy to set the whole loom with all its shuttles in motion by simply moving a rod backwards and forwards and in its improved form produced from to pieces at once about a windsawmill erected near london by a dutchman succumbed to the excesses of the populace even as late as the beginning of the th century sawmills driven by water overcame the opposition of the people supported as it was by parliament only with great difficulty no sooner had everet in erected the first woolshearing machine that was driven by waterpower than it was set on fire by people who had been thrown out of work fifty thousand workpeople who had previously lived by carding wool petitioned parliament against arkwright’s scribbling mills and carding engines the enormous destruction of machinery that occurred in the english manufacturing districts during the first years of this century chiefly caused by the employment of the powerloom and known as the luddite movement gave the antijacobin governments of a sidmouth a castlereagh and the like a pretext for the most reactionary and forcible measures it took both time and experience before the workpeople learnt to distinguish between machinery and its employment by capital and to direct their attacks not against the material instruments of production but against the mode in which they are used the contests about wages in manufacture presuppose manufacture and are in no sense directed against its existence the opposition against the establishment of new manufactures proceeds from the guilds and privileged towns not from the workpeople hence the writers of the manufacturing period treat the division of labour chiefly as a means of virtually supplying a deficiency of labourers and not as a means of actually displacing those in work this distinction is selfevident if it be said that millions of people would be required in england to spin with the old spinningwheel the cotton that is now spun with mules by people this does not mean that the mules took the place of those millions who never existed it means only this that many millions of workpeople would be required to replace the spinning machinery if on the other hand we say that in england the powerloom threw weavers on the streets we do not refer to existing machinery that would have to be replaced by a definite number of workpeople but to a number of weavers in existence who were actually replaced or displaced by the looms during the manufacturing period handicraft labour altered though it was by division of labour was yet the basis the demands of the new colonial markets could not be satisfied owing to the relatively small number of town operatives handed down from the middle ages and the manufactures proper opened out new fields of production to the rural population driven from the land by the dissolution of the feudal system at that time therefore division of labour and cooperation in the workshops were viewed more from the positive aspect that they made the workpeople more productive long before the period of modern industry cooperation and the concentration of the instruments of labour in the hands of a few gave rise in numerous countries where these methods were applied in agriculture to great sudden and forcible revolutions in the modes of production and consequentially in the conditions of existence and the means of employment of the rural populations but this contest at first takes place more between the large and the small landed proprietors than between capital and wage labour on the other hand when the labourers are displaced by the instruments of labour by sheep horses c in this case force is directly resorted to in the first instance as the prelude to the industrial revolution the labourers are first driven from the land and then come the sheep land grabbing on a great scale such as was perpetrated in england is the first step in creating a field for the establishment of agriculture on a great scale hence this subversion of agriculture puts on at first more the appearance of a political revolution the instrument of labour when it takes the form of a machine immediately becomes a competitor of the workman himself the selfexpansion of capital by means of machinery is thenceforward directly proportional to the number of the workpeople whose means of livelihood have been destroyed by that machinery the whole system of capitalist production is based on the fact that the workman sells his labourpower as a commodity division of labour specialises this labourpower by reducing it to skill in handling a particular tool so soon as the handling of this tool becomes the work of a machine then with the usevalue the exchangevalue too of the workman’s labourpower vanishes the workman becomes unsaleable like paper money thrown out of currency by legal enactment that portion of the workingclass thus by machinery rendered superfluous ie no longer immediately necessary for the selfexpansion of capital either goes to the wall in the unequal contest of the old handicrafts and manufactures with machinery or else floods all the more easily accessible branches of industry swamps the labourmarket and sinks the price of labourpower below its value it is impressed upon the workpeople as a great consolation first that their sufferings are only temporary “a temporary inconvenience secondly that machinery acquires the mastery over the whole of a given field of production only by degrees so that the extent and intensity of its destructive effect is diminished the first consolation neutralises the second when machinery seizes on an industry by degrees it produces chronic misery among the operatives who compete with it where the transition is rapid the effect is acute and felt by great masses history discloses no tragedy more horrible than the gradual extinction of the english handloom weavers an extinction that was spread over several decades and finally sealed in many of them died of starvation many with families vegetated for a long time on ½ d a day on the other hand the english cotton machinery produced an acute effect in india the governor general reported “the misery hardly finds a parallel in the history of commerce the bones of the cottonweavers are bleaching the plains of india” no doubt in turning them out of this “temporal” world the machinery caused them no more than “a temporary inconvenience” for the rest since machinery is continually seizing upon new fields of production its temporary effect is really permanent hence the character of independence and estrangement which the capitalist mode of production as a whole gives to the instruments of labour and to the product as against the workman is developed by means of machinery into a thorough antagonism therefore it is with the advent of machinery that the workman for the first time brutally revolts against the instruments of labour the instrument of labour strikes down the labourer this direct antagonism between the two comes out most strongly whenever newly introduced machinery competes with handicrafts or manufactures handed down from former times but even in modern industry the continual improvement of machinery and the development of the automatic system has an analogous effect “the object of improved machinery is to diminish manual labour to provide for the performance of a process or the completion of a link in a manufacture by the aid of an iron instead of the human apparatus” “the adaptation of power to machinery heretofore moved by hand is almost of daily occurrence the minor improvements in machinery having for their object economy of power the production of better work the turning off more work in the same time or in supplying the place of a child a female or a man are constant and although sometimes apparently of no great moment have somewhat important results” “whenever a process requires peculiar dexterity and steadiness of hand it is withdrawn as soon as possible from the cunning workman who is prone to irregularities of many kinds and it is placed in charge of a peculiar mechanism so selfregulating that a child can superintend it” “on the automatic plan skilled labour gets progressively superseded” “the effect of improvements in machinery not merely in superseding the necessity for the employment of the same quantity of adult labour as before in order to produce a given result but in substituting one description of human labour for another the less skilled for the more skilled juvenile for adult female for male causes a fresh disturbance in the rate of wages” “the effect of substituting the selfacting mule for the common mule is to discharge the greater part of the men spinners and to retain adolescents and children” the extraordinary power of expansion of the factory system owing to accumulated practical experience to the mechanical means at hand and to constant technical progress was proved to us by the giant strides of that system under the pressure of a shortened working day but who in the zenith year of the english cotton industry would have dreamt of the galloping improvements in machinery and the corresponding displacement of working people called into being during the following years under the stimulus of the american civil war a couple of examples from the reports of the inspectors of factories will suffice on this point a manchester manufacturer states “we formerly had carding engines now we have doing the same quantity of work we are doing with fewer hands by at a saving in wages of £ aweek our estimated saving in waste is about in the quantity of cotton consumed” “in another finespinning mill in manchester i was informed that through increased speed and the adoption of some selfacting processes a reduction had been made in number of a fourth in one department and of above half in another and that the introduction of the combing machine in place of the second carding had considerably reduced the number of hands formerly employed in the cardingroom” another spinningmill is estimated to effect a saving of labour of the messrs gilmour spinners at manchester state “in our blowingroom department we consider our expense with new machinery is fully onethird less in wages and hands in the jackframe and drawingframe room about onethird less in expense and likewise onethird less in hands in the spinning room about onethird less in expenses but this is not all when our yarn goes to the manufacturers it is so much better by the application of our new machinery that they will produce a greater quantity of cloth and cheaper than from the yarn produced by old machinery” mr redgrave further remarks in the same report “the reduction of hands against increased production is in fact constantly taking place in woollen mills the reduction commenced some time since and is continuing a few days since the master of a school in the neighbourhood of rochdale said to me that the great falling off in the girls’ school is not only caused by the distress but by the changes of machinery in the woollen mills in consequence of which a reduction of shorttimers had taken place” the following table shows the total result of the mechanical improvements in the english cotton industry due to the american civil war number of factories england and wales scotland ireland united kingdom number of power looms england and wales scotland ireland united kingdom number of spindles england and wales scotland ireland united kingdom number of persons employed england and wales scotland ireland united kingdom hence between and cotton factories disappeared in other words more productive machinery on a larger scale was concentrated in the hands of a smaller number of capitalists the number of powerlooms decreased by but since their product increased in the same period an improved loom must have yielded more than an old one lastly the number of spindles increased by while the number of operatives decreased by the “temporary” misery inflicted on the workpeople by the cottoncrisis was heightened and from being temporary made permanent by the rapid and persistent progress of machinery but machinery not only acts as a competitor who gets the better of the workman and is constantly on the point of making him superfluous it is also a power inimical to him and as such capital proclaims it from the roof tops and as such makes use of it it is the most powerful weapon for repressing strikes those periodical revolts of the workingclass against the autocracy of capital according to gaskell the steamengine was from the very first an antagonist of human power an antagonist that enabled the capitalist to tread under foot the growing claims of the workmen who threatened the newly born factory system with a crisis it would be possible to write quite a history of the inventions made since for the sole purpose of supplying capital with weapons against the revolts of the workingclass at the head of these in importance stands the selfacting mule because it opened up a new epoch in the automatic system nasmyth the inventor of the steamhammer gives the following evidence before the trades’ union commission with regard to the improvements made by him in machinery and introduced in consequence of the widespread and long strikes of the engineers in “the characteristic feature of our modern mechanical improvements is the introduction of selfacting tool machinery what every mechanical workman has now to do and what every boy can do is not to work himself but to superintend the beautiful labour of the machine the whole class of workmen that depend exclusively on their skill is now done away with formerly i employed four boys to every mechanic thanks to these new mechanical combinations i have reduced the number of grownup men from to the result was a considerable increase in my profits” ure says of a machine used in calico printing “at length capitalists sought deliverance from this intolerable bondage” namely the in their eyes burdensome terms of their contracts with the workmen “in the resources of science and were speedily reinstated in their legitimate rule that of the head over the inferior members” speaking of an invention for dressing warps “then the combined malcontents who fancied themselves impregnably entrenched behind the old lines of division of labour found their flanks turned and their defences rendered useless by the new mechanical tactics and were obliged to surrender at discretion” with regard to the invention of the selfacting mule he says “a creation destined to restore order among the industrious classes this invention confirms the great doctrine already propounded that when capital enlists science into her service the refractory hand of labour will always be taught docility” although ure’s work appeared years ago at a time when the factory system was comparatively but little developed it still perfectly expresses the spirit of the factory not only by its undisguised cynicism but also by the naïveté with which it blurts out the stupid contradictions of the capitalist brain for instance after propounding the “doctrine” stated above that capital with the aid of science taken into its pay always reduces the refractory hand of labour to docility he grows indignant because “it physicomechanical science has been accused of lending itself to the rich capitalist as an instrument for harassing the poor” after preaching a long sermon to show how advantageous the rapid development of machinery is to the workingclasses he warns them that by their obstinacy and their strikes they hasten that development “violent revulsions of this nature” he says “display shortsighted man in the contemptible character of a selftormentor” a few pages before he states the contrary “had it not been for the violent collisions and interruptions resulting from erroneous views among the factory operatives the factory system would have been developed still more rapidly and beneficially for all concerned” then he exclaims again “fortunately for the state of society in the cotton districts of great britain the improvements in machinery are gradual” “it” improvement in machinery “is said to lower the rate of earnings of adults by displacing a portion of them and thus rendering their number superabundant as compared with the demand for their labour it certainly augments the demand for the labour of children and increases the rate of their wages” on the other hand this same dispenser of consolation defends the lowness of the children’s wages on the ground that it prevents parents from sending their children at too early an age into the factory the whole of his book is a vindication of a working day of unrestricted length that parliament should forbid children of years to be exhausted by working hours a day reminds his liberal soul of the darkest days of the middle ages this does not prevent him from calling upon the factory operatives to thank providence who by means of machinery has given them the leisure to think of their “immortal interests” section the theory of compensation as regards the workpeople displaced by machinery james mill macculloch torrens senior john stuart mill and a whole series besides of bourgeois political economists insist that all machinery that displaces workmen simultaneously and necessarily sets free an amount of capital adequate to employ the same identical workmen suppose a capitalist to employ workmen at £ a year each in a carpet factory the variable capital annually laid out amounts therefore to £ suppose also that he discharges of his workmen and employs the remaining with machinery that costs him £ to simplify matters we take no account of buildings coal c further suppose that the raw material annually consumed costs £ both before and after the change is any capital set free by this metamorphosis before the change the total sum of £ consisted half of constant and half of variable capital after the change it consists of £ constant £ raw material and £ machinery and £ variable capital the variable capital instead of being one half is only one quarter of the total capital instead of being set free a part of the capital is here locked up in such a way as to cease to be exchanged against labourpower variable has been changed into constant capital other things remaining unchanged the capital of £ can in future employ no more than men with each improvement in the machinery it will employ fewer if the newly introduced machinery had cost less than did the labourpower and implements displaced by it if for instance instead of costing £ it had cost only £ a variable capital of £ would have been converted into constant capital and locked up and a capital of £ would have been set free the latter sum supposing wages unchanged would form a fund sufficient to employ about out of the men discharged nay less than for in order to be employed as capital a part of this £ must now become constant capital thus leaving only the remainder to be laid out in labourpower but suppose besides that the making of the new machinery affords employment to a greater number of mechanics can that be called compensation to the carpetmakers thrown on the streets at the best its construction employs fewer men than its employment displaces the sum of £ that formerly represented the wages of the discharged carpetmakers now represents in the shape of machinery the value of the means of production used in the construction of that machinery the wages of the mechanics employed in its construction and the surplusvalue falling to the share of their “master” further the machinery need not be renewed till it is worn out hence in order to keep the increased number of mechanics in constant employment one carpet manufacturer after another must displace workmen by machines as a matter of fact the apologists do not mean this sort of setting free they have in their minds the means of subsistence of the liberated workpeople it cannot be denied in the above instance that the machinery not only liberates men thus placing them at others’ disposal but at the same time it withdraws from their consumption and sets free means of subsistence to the value of £ the simple fact by no means a new one that machinery cuts off the workmen from their means of subsistence is therefore in economic parlance tantamount to this that machinery liberates means of subsistence for the workman or converts those means into capital for his employment the mode of expression you see is everything nominibus mollire licet mala this theory implies that the £ worth of means of subsistence was capital that was being expanded by the labour of the men discharged that consequently this capital falls out of employment so soon as they commence their forced holidays and never rests till it has found a fresh investment where it can again be productively consumed by these same men that sooner or later therefore the capital and the workmen must come together again and that then the compensation is complete that the sufferings of the workmen displaced by machinery are therefore as transient as are the riches of this world in relation to the discharged workmen the £ worth of means of subsistence never was capital what really confronted them as capital was the sum of £ afterwards laid out in machinery on looking closer it will be seen that this sum represented part of the carpets produced in a year by the discharged men which part they received as wages from their employer in money instead of in kind with the carpets in the form of money they bought means of subsistence to the value of £ these means therefore were to them not capital but commodities and they as regards these commodities were not wagelabourers but buyers the circumstance that they were “freed” by the machinery from the means of purchase changed them from buyers into nonbuyers hence a lessened demand for those commodities – voilà tout if this diminution be not compensated by an increase from some other quarter the market price of the commodities falls if this state of things lasts for some time and extends there follows a discharge of workmen employed in the production of these commodities some of the capital that was previously devoted to production of necessary means of subsistence has to become reproduced in another form while prices fall and capital is being displaced the labourers employed in the production of necessary means of subsistence are in their turn “freed” from a part of their wages instead therefore of proving that when machinery frees the workman from his means of subsistence it simultaneously converts those means into capital for his further employment our apologists with their cutanddried law of supply and demand prove on the contrary that machinery throws workmen on the streets not only in that branch of production in which it is introduced but also in those branches in which it is not introduced the real facts which are travestied by the optimism of economists are as follows the labourers when driven out of the workshop by the machinery are thrown upon the labour market and there add to the number of workmen at the disposal of the capitalists in part vii of this book it will be seen that this effect of machinery which as we have seen is represented to be a compensation to the working class is on the contrary a most frightful scourge for the present i will only say this the labourers that are thrown out of work in any branch of industry can no doubt seek for employment in some other branch if they find it and thus renew the bond between them and the means of subsistence this takes place only by the intermediary of a new and additional capital that is seeking investment not at all by the intermediary of the capital that formerly employed them and was afterwards converted into machinery and even should they find employment what a poor lookout is theirs crippled as they are by division of labour these poor devils are worth so little outside their old trade that they cannot find admission into any industries except a few of inferior kind that are oversupplied with underpaid workmen further every branch of industry attracts each year a new stream of men who furnish a contingent from which to fill up vacancies and to draw a supply for expansion so soon as machinery sets free a part of the workmen employed in a given branch of industry the reserve men are also diverted into new channels of employment and become absorbed in other branches meanwhile the original victims during the period of transition for the most part starve and perish it is an undoubted fact that machinery as such is not responsible for “setting free” the workman from the means of subsistence it cheapens and increases production in that branch which it seizes on and at first makes no change in the mass of the means of subsistence produced in other branches hence after its introduction the society possesses as much if not more of the necessaries of life than before for the labourers thrown out of work and that quite apart from the enormous share of the annual produce wasted by the nonworkers and this is the point relied on by our apologists the contradictions and antagonisms inseparable from the capitalist employment of machinery do not exist they say since they do not arise out of machinery as such but out of its capitalist employment since therefore machinery considered alone shortens the hours of labour but when in the service of capital lengthens them since in itself it lightens labour but when employed by capital heightens the intensity of labour since in itself it is a victory of man over the forces of nature but in the hands of capital makes man the slave of those forces since in itself it increases the wealth of the producers but in the hands of capital makes them paupers for all these reasons and others besides says the bourgeois economist without more ado it is clear as noonday that all these contradictions are a mere semblance of the reality and that as a matter of fact they have neither an actual nor a theoretical existence thus he saves himself from all further puzzling of the brain and what is more implicitly declares his opponent to be stupid enough to contend against not the capitalistic employment of machinery but machinery itself no doubt he is far from denying that temporary inconvenience may result from the capitalist use of machinery but where is the medal without its reverse any employment of machinery except by capital is to him an impossibility exploitation of the workman by the machine is therefore with him identical with exploitation of the machine by the workman whoever therefore exposes the real state of things in the capitalistic employment of machinery is against its employment in any way and is an enemy of social progress exactly the reasoning of the celebrated bill sykes “gentlemen of the jury no doubt the throat of this commercial traveller has been cut but that is not my fault it is the fault of the knife must we for such a temporary inconvenience abolish the use of the knife only consider where would agriculture and trade be without the knife is it not as salutary in surgery as it is knowing in anatomy and in addition a willing help at the festive board if you abolish the knife – you hurl us back into the depths of barbarism” although machinery necessarily throws men out of work in those industries into which it is introduced yet it may notwithstanding this bring about an increase of employment in other industries this effect however has nothing in common with the socalled theory of compensation since every article produced by a machine is cheaper than a similar article produced by hand we deduce the following infallible law if the total quantity of the article produced by machinery be equal to the total quantity of the article previously produced by a handicraft or by manufacture and now made by machinery then the total labour expended is diminished the new labour spent on the instruments of labour on the machinery on the coal and so on must necessarily be less than the labour displaced by the use of the machinery otherwise the product of the machine would be as dear or dearer than the product of the manual labour but as a matter of fact the total quantity of the article produced by machinery with a diminished number of workmen instead of remaining equal to by far exceeds the total quantity of the handmade article that has been displaced suppose that yards of cloth have been produced on powerlooms by fewer weavers than could weave yards by hand in the quadrupled product there lies four times as much raw material hence the production of raw material must be quadrupled but as regards the instruments of labour such as buildings coal machinery and so on it is different the limit up to which the additional labour required for their production can increase varies with the difference between the quantity of the machinemade article and the quantity of the same article that the same number of workmen could make by hand hence as the use of machinery extends in a given industry the immediate effect is to increase production in the other industries that furnish the first with means of production how far employment is thereby found for an increased number of men depends given the length of the working day and the intensity of labour on the composition of the capital employed ie on the ratio of its constant to its variable component this ratio in its turn varies considerably with the extent to which machinery has already seized on or is then seizing on those trades the number of the men condemned to work in coal and metal mines increased enormously owing to the progress of the english factory system but during the last few decades this increase of number has been less rapid owing to the use of new machinery in mining a new type of workman springs into life along with the machine namely its maker we have already learnt that machinery has possessed itself even of this branch of production on a scale that grows greater every day as to raw material there is not the least doubt that the rapid strides of cotton spinning not only pushed on with tropical luxuriance the growth of cotton in the united states and with it the african slave trade but also made the breeding of slaves the chief business of the border slavestates when in the first census of slaves was taken in the united states their number was in it had nearly reached four millions on the other hand it is no less certain that the rise of the english woollen factories together with the gradual conversion of arable land into sheep pasture brought about the superfluity of agricultural labourers that led to their being driven in masses into the towns ireland having during the last twenty years reduced its population by nearly one half is at this moment undergoing the process of still further reducing the number of its inhabitants so as exactly to suit the requirements of its landlords and of the english woollen manufacturers when machinery is applied to any of the preliminary or intermediate stages through which the subject of labour has to pass on its way to completion there is an increased yield of material in those stages and simultaneously an increased demand for labour in the handicrafts or manufactures supplied by the produce of the machines spinning by machinery for example supplied yarn so cheaply and so abundantly that the handloom weavers were at first able to work full time without increased outlay their earnings accordingly rose hence a flow of people into the cottonweaving trade till at length the weavers called into existence by the jenny the throstle and the mule were overwhelmed by the powerloom so also owing to the abundance of clothing materials produced by machinery the number of tailors seamstresses and needlewomen went on increasing until the appearance of the sewingmachine in proportion as machinery with the aid of a relatively small number of workpeople increases the mass of raw materials intermediate products instruments of labour c the workingup of these raw materials and intermediate products becomes split up into numberless branches social production increases in diversity the factory system carries the social division of labour immeasurably further than does manufacture for it increases the productiveness of the industries it seizes upon in a far higher degree the immediate result of machinery is to augment surplusvalue and the mass of products in which surplusvalue is embodied and as the substances consumed by the capitalists and their dependents become more plentiful so too do these orders of society their growing wealth and the relatively diminished number of workmen required to produce the necessaries of life beget simultaneously with the rise of new and luxurious wants the means of satisfying those wants a larger portion of the produce of society is changed into surplusproduce and a larger part of the surplusproduce is supplied for consumption in a multiplicity of refined shapes in other words the production of luxuries increases the refined and varied forms of the products are also due to new relations with the markets of the world relations that are created by modern industry not only are greater quantities of foreign articles of luxury exchanged for home products but a greater mass of foreign raw materials ingredients and intermediate products are used as means of production in the home industries owing to these relations with the markets of the world the demand for labour increases in the carrying trades which split up into numerous varieties the increase of the means of production and subsistence accompanied by a relative diminution in the number of labourers causes an increased demand for labour in making canals docks tunnels bridges and so on works that can only bear fruit in the far future entirely new branches of production creating new fields of labour are also formed as the direct result either of machinery or of the general industrial changes brought about by it but the place occupied by these branches in the general production is even in the most developed countries far from important the number of labourers that find employment in them is directly proportional to the demand created by those industries for the crudest form of manual labour the chief industries of this kind are at present gasworks telegraphs photography steam navigation and railways according to the census of for england and wales we find in the gas industry gasworks production of mechanical apparatus servants of the gas companies c persons in telegraphy in photography steam navigation and in railways of whom the unskilled “navvies” more or less permanently employed and the whole administrative and commercial staff make up about the total number of persons therefore employed in these five new industries amounts to lastly the extraordinary productiveness of modern industry accompanied as it is by both a more extensive and a more intense exploitation of labourpower in all other spheres of production allows of the unproductive employment of a larger and larger part of the workingclass and the consequent reproduction on a constantly extending scale of the ancient domestic slaves under the name of a servant class including menservants womenservants lackeys c according to the census of the population of england and wales was of these males and females if we deduct from this population all who are too old or too young for work all unproductive women young persons and children the “ideological” classes such as government officials priests lawyers soldiers c further all who have no occupation but to consume the labour of others in the form of rent interest c and lastly paupers vagabonds and criminals there remain in round numbers eight millions of the two sexes of every age including in that number every capitalist who is in any way engaged in industry commerce or finance among these millions are persons agricultural labourers including shepherds farm servants and maidservants living in the houses of farmers all who are employed in cotton woollen worsted flax hemp silk and jute factories in stocking making and lace making by machinery all who are employed in coal mines and metal mines all who are employed in metal works blastfurnaces rolling mills c and metal manufactures of every kind the servant class all the persons employed in textile factories and in mines taken together number those employed in textile factories and metal industries taken together number in both cases less than the number of modern domestic slaves what a splendid result of the capitalist exploitation of machinery section repulsion and attraction of workpeople by the factory system crises in the cotton trade all political economists of any standing admit that the introduction of new machinery has a baneful effect on the workmen in the old handicrafts and manufactures with which this machinery at first competes almost all of them bemoan the slavery of the factory operative and what is the great trumpcard that they play that machinery after the horrors of the period of introduction and development have subsided instead of diminishing in the long run increases the number of the slaves of labour yes political economy revels in the hideous theory hideous to every “philanthropist” who believes in the eternal natureordained necessity for capitalist production that after a period of growth and transition even its crowning success the factory system based on machinery grinds down more workpeople than on its first introduction it throws on the streets it is true that in some cases as we saw from instances of english worsted and silk factories an extraordinary extension of the factory system may at a certain stage of its development be accompanied not only by a relative but by an absolute decrease in the number of operatives employed in the year when a special census of all the factories in the united kingdom was taken by order of parliament the factories in those parts of lancashire cheshire and yorkshire included in the district of mr baker the factory inspector numbered of these contained powerlooms spindles exclusive of doubling spindles employed horsepower steam and water and persons in the year the same factories contained looms spindles had a steampower of horses and a waterpower of horses and employed persons between and therefore the increase in looms was in spindles and in enginepower while the number of persons employed decreased ½ between and considerable extension of the english woollen manufacture took place while the number of hands employed in it remained almost stationary “showing how greatly the introduction of new machines had superseded the labour of preceding periods” in certain cases the increase in the number of hands employed is only apparent that is it is not due to the extension of the factories already established but to the gradual annexation of connected trades for instance the increase in powerlooms and in the hands employed by them between and was in the cotton trade simply owing to the extension of this branch of industry but in the other trades to the application of steampower to the carpetloom to the ribbonloom and to the linenloom which previously had been worked by the power of men hence the increase of the hands in these latter trades was merely a symptom of a diminution in the total number employed finally we have considered this question entirely apart from the fact that everywhere except in the metal industries young persons under and women and children form the preponderating element in the class of factory hands nevertheless in spite of the mass of hands actually displaced and virtually replaced by machinery we can understand how the factory operatives through the building of more mills and the extension of old ones in a given industry may become more numerous than the manufacturing workmen and handicraftsman that have been displaced suppose for example that in the old mode of production a capital of £ is employed weekly twofifths being constant and threefifths variable capital ie £ being laid out in means of production and £ say £ per man in labourpower on the introduction of machinery the composition of this capital becomes altered we will suppose it to consist of fourfifths constant and onefifth variable which means that only £ is now laid out in labourpower consequently twothirds of the workmen are discharged if now the business extends and the total capital employed grows to £ under unchanged conditions the number of operatives employed will increase to just as many as before the introduction of the machinery if the capital further grows to £ men will be employed or onethird more than under the old system their numbers have in point of fact increased by but relatively ie in proportion to the total capital advanced they have diminished by for the £ capital would in the old state of things have employed instead of men hence a relative decrease in the number of hands is consistent with an actual increase we assumed above that while the total capital increases its composition remains the same because the conditions of production remain constant but we have already seen that with every advance in the use of machinery the constant component of capital that part which consists of machinery raw material c increases while the variable component the part laid out in labourpower decreases we also know that in no other system of production is improvement so continuous and the composition of the capital employed so constantly changing as in the factory system these changes are however continually interrupted by periods of rest during which there is a mere quantitative extension of the factories on the existing technical basis during such periods the operatives increase in number thus in the total number of operatives in the cotton woollen worsted flax and silk factories of the united kingdom was only while in the number of the powerloom weavers alone of both sexes and of all ages from eight years upwards amounted to certainly this growth appears less important when we consider that in the handloom weavers with their families still numbered not to mention those thrown out of work in asia and on the continent of europe in the few remarks i have still to make on this point i shall refer to some actually existing relations the existence of which our theoretical investigation has not yet disclosed so long as in a given branch of industry the factory system extends itself at the expense of the old handicrafts or of manufacture the result is as sure as is the result of an encounter between an army furnished with breachloaders and one armed with bows and arrows this first period during which machinery conquers its field of action is of decisive importance owing to the extraordinary profits that it helps to produce these profits not only form a source of accelerated accumulation but also attract into the favoured sphere of production a large part of the additional social capital that is being constantly created and is ever on the lookout for new investments the special advantages of this first period of fast and furious activity are felt in every branch of production that machinery invades so soon however as the factory system has gained a certain breadth of footing and a definite degree of maturity and especially so soon as its technical basis machinery is itself produced by machinery so soon as coal mining and iron mining the metal industries and the means of transport have been revolutionised so soon in short as the general conditions requisite for production by the modern industrial system have been established this mode of production acquires an elasticity a capacity for sudden extension by leaps and bounds that finds no hindrance except in the supply of raw material and in the disposal of the produce on the one hand the immediate effect of machinery is to increase the supply of raw material in the same way for example as the cotton gin augmented the production of cotton on the other hand the cheapness of the articles produced by machinery and the improved means of transport and communication furnish the weapons for conquering foreign markets by ruining handicraft production in other countries machinery forcibly converts them into fields for the supply of its raw material in this way east india was compelled to produce cotton wool hemp jute and indigo for great britain by constantly making a part of the hands “supernumerary” modern industry in all countries where it has taken root gives a spur to emigration and to the colonisation of foreign lands which are thereby converted into settlements for growing the raw material of the mother country just as australia for example was converted into a colony for growing wool a new and international division of labour a division suited to the requirements of the chief centres of modern industry springs up and converts one part of the globe into a chiefly agricultural field of production for supplying the other part which remains a chiefly industrial field this revolution hangs together with radical changes in agriculture which we need not here further inquire into on the motion of mr gladstone the house of commons ordered on the th february a return of the total quantities of grain corn and flour of all sorts imported into and exported from the united kingdom between the years and i give below a summary of the result the flour is given in quarters of corn see the table on p quinquennial periods and the year annual average import export excess of import over export population yearly average in each period average quantity of corn etc in qrs consumed annually per head over and above the home produce consumed the enormous power inherent in the factory system of expanding by jumps and the dependence of that system on the markets of the world necessarily beget feverish production followed by overfilling of the markets whereupon contraction of the markets brings on crippling of production the life of modern industry becomes a series of periods of moderate activity prosperity overproduction crisis and stagnation the uncertainty and instability to which machinery subjects the employment and consequently the conditions of existence of the operatives become normal owing to these periodic changes of the industrial cycle except in the periods of prosperity there rages between the capitalists the most furious combat for the share of each in the markets this share is directly proportional to the cheapness of the product besides the rivalry that this struggle begets in the application of improved machinery for replacing labourpower and of new methods of production there also comes a time in every industrial cycle when a forcible reduction of wages beneath the value of labourpower is attempted for the purpose of cheapening commodities a necessary condition therefore to the growth of the number of factory hands is a proportionally much more rapid growth of the amount of capital invested in mills this growth however is conditioned by the ebb and flow of the industrial cycle it is besides constantly interrupted by the technical progress that at one time virtually supplies the place of new workmen at another actually displaces old ones this qualitative change in mechanical industry continually discharges hands from the factory or shuts its doors against the fresh stream of recruits while the purely quantitative extension of the factories absorbs not only the men thrown out of work but also fresh contingents the workpeople are thus continually both repelled and attracted hustled from pillar to post while at the same time constant changes take place in the sex age and skill of the levies the lot of the factory operatives will be best depicted by taking a rapid survey of the course of the english cotton industry from to this trade was depressed or stagnant for years only during this period of years the english manufacturers had a monopoly of machinery and of the markets of the world from to depression and prosperity abolition of the laws against trades’ unions great extension of factories everywhere crisis great misery and riots among the factory operatives slight improvement great increase in powerlooms and in exports exports especially to india surpass all former years glutted markets great distress to continued depression the monopoly of the trade with india and china withdrawn from the east india company great increase of factories and machinery shortness of hands the new poor law furthers the migration of agricultural labourers into the factory districts the country districts swept of children white slave trade great prosperity contemporaneous starvation of the handloom weavers great prosperity and depression and crisis revival great depression riots calling out of the military and frightful suffering among the factory operatives the manufacturers lock the hands out of the factories in order to enforce the repeal of the corn laws the operatives stream in thousands into the towns of lancashire and yorkshire are driven back by the military and their leaders brought to trial at lancaster great misery revival great prosperity continued improvement at first then reaction repeal of the corn laws crisis general reduction of wages by and more per cent in honour of the “big loaf continued depression manchester under military protection revival prosperity falling prices low wages frequent strikes improvement begins strikes continue the manufacturers threaten to import foreign hands increasing exports strike for months and great misery at preston prosperity glutted markets news of failures stream in from the united states canada and the eastern markets great prosperity crisis improvement great prosperity increase in factories zenith of the english cotton trade the indian australian and other markets so glutted with goods that even in they had not absorbed the whole lot the french treaty of commerce enormous growth of factories and machinery prosperity continues for a time reaction the american civil war cotton famine to complete collapse the history of the cotton famine is too characteristic to dispense with dwelling upon it for a moment from the indications as to the condition of the markets of the world in and we see that the cotton famine came in the nick of time for the manufacturers and was to some extent advantageous to them a fact that was acknowledged in the reports of the manchester chamber of commerce proclaimed in parliament by palmerston and derby and confirmed by events no doubt among the cotton mills in the united kingdom in there were many of small size according to the report of mr a redgrave out of the mills included in his district or employed less than ten horsepower each or employed h p and less than h p while employed upwards of h p the majority of the small mills were weaving sheds built during the period of prosperity after for the most part by speculators of whom one supplied the yarn another the machinery a third the buildings and were worked by men who had been overlookers or by other persons of small means these small manufacturers mostly went to the wall the same fate would have overtaken them in the commercial crisis that was staved off only by the cotton famine although they formed onethird of the total number of manufacturers yet their mills absorbed a much smaller part of the capital invested in the cotton trade as to the extent of the stoppage it appears from authentic estimates that in october of the spindles and of the looms were standing this refers to the cotton trade as a whole and of course requires considerable modification for individual districts only very few mills worked full time hours a week the remainder worked at intervals even in those few cases where full time was worked and at the customary rate of piecewage the weekly wages of the operatives necessarily shrank owing to good cotton being replaced by bad sea island by egyptian in fine spinning mills american and egyptian by surat and pure cotton by mixings of waste and surat the shorter fibre of the surat cotton and its dirty condition the greater fragility of the thread the substitution of all sorts of heavy ingredients for flour in sizing the warps all these lessened the speed of the machinery or the number of the looms that could be superintended by one weaver increased the labour caused by defects in the machinery and reduced the piecewage by reducing the mass of the product turned off where surat cotton was used the loss to the operatives when on full time amounted to and more per cent but besides this the majority of the manufacturers reduced the rate of piecewage by ½ and per cent we can therefore conceive the situation of those hands who were employed for only ½ or days a week or for only hours a day even in after a comparative improvement had set in the weekly wages of spinners and of weavers were s d s d s d and s d even in this miserable state of things however the inventive spirit of the master never stood still but was exercised in making deductions from wages these were to some extent inflicted as a penalty for defects in the finished article that were really due to his bad cotton and to his unsuitable machinery moreover where the manufacturer owned the cottages of the workpeople he paid himself his rents by deducting the amount from these miserable wages mr redgrave tells us of selfacting minders operatives who manage a pair of selfacting mules “earning at the end of a fortnight’s full work s d and that from this sum was deducted the rent of the house the manufacturer however returning half the rent as a gift the minders took away the sum of s d in many places the selfacting minders ranged from s to s per week and the weavers from s to s per week during the latter part of ” even when working short time the rent was frequently deducted from the wages of the operatives no wonder that in some parts of lancashire a kind of famine fever broke out but more characteristic than all this was the revolution that took place in the process of production at the expense of the workpeople experimenta in corpore vili like those of anatomists on frogs were formally made “although” says mr redgrave “i have given the actual earnings of the operatives in the several mills it does not follow that they earn the same amount week by week the operatives are subject to great fluctuation from the constant experimentalising of the manufacturers the earnings of the operatives rise and fall with the quality of the cotton mixings sometimes they have been within per cent of former earnings and then in a week or two they have fallen off from to per cent” these experiments were not made solely at the expense of the workman’s means of subsistence his five senses also had to pay the penalty “the people who are employed in making up surat cotton complain very much they inform me on opening the bales of cotton there is an intolerable smell which causes sickness in the mixing scribbling and carding rooms the dust and dirt which are disengaged irritate the air passages and give rise to cough and difficulty of breathing a disease of the skin no doubt from the irritation of the dirt contained in the surat cotton also prevails the fibre being so short a great amount of size both animal and vegetable is used bronchitis is more prevalent owing to the dust inflammatory sore throat is common from the same cause sickness and dyspepsia are produced by the frequent breaking of the weft when the weaver sucks the weft through the eye of the shuttle” on the other hand the substitutes for flour were a fortunatus’ purse to the manufacturers by increasing the weight of the yarn they caused “ lbs of raw material to weigh lbs after it was woven” in the report of inspectors of factories for th april we read as follows “the trade is availing itself of this resource at present to an extent which is even discreditable i have heard on good authority of a cloth weighing lbs which was made of lbs cotton and lbs size and of another cloth weighing lbs of which lbs was size these were ordinary export shirtings in cloths of other descriptions as much as per cent size is sometimes added so that a manufacturer may and does truly boast that he is getting rich by selling cloth for less money per pound than he paid for the mere yarn of which they are composed” but the workpeople had to suffer not only from the experiments of the manufacturers inside the mills and of the municipalities outside not only from reduced wages and absence of work from want and from charity and from the eulogistic speeches of lords and commons “unfortunate females who in consequence of the cotton famine were at its commencement thrown out of employment and have thereby become outcasts of society and now though trade has revived and work is plentiful continue members of that unfortunate class and are likely to continue so there are also in the borough more youthful prostitutes than i have known for the last years” we find then in the first years of the english cotton trade from to only years of crisis and stagnation but this was the period of monopoly the second period from to counts during its years only years of revival and prosperity against of depression and stagnation between and the competition with the continent of europe and with the united states sets in after the extension of the asiatic markets is enforced by “destruction of the human race” the wholesale extinction of indian handloom weavers after the repeal of the corn laws from to there are years of moderate activity and prosperity against years of depression and stagnation the condition of the adult male operatives even during the years of prosperity may be judged from the note subjoined section revolution effected in manufacture handicrafts and domestic industry by modern industry a overthrow of cooperation based on handicraft and on the division of labour we have seen how machinery does away with cooperation based on handicrafts and with manufacture based on the division of handicraft labour an example of the first sort is the mowingmachine it replaces cooperation between mowers a striking example of the second kind is the needlemaking machine according to adam smith men in his day made in cooperation over needles aday on the other hand a single needlemachine makes in a working day of hours one woman or one girl superintends four such machines and so produces near upon needles in a day and upwards of in a week a single machine when it takes the place of cooperation or of manufacture may itself serve as the basis of an industry of a handicraft character still such a return to handicrafts is but a transition to the factory system which as a rule makes its appearance so soon as the human muscles are replaced for the purpose of driving the machines by a mechanical motive power such as steam or water here and there but in any case only for a time an industry may be carried on on a small scale by means of mechanical power this is effected by hiring steampower as is done in some of the birmingham trades or by the use of small caloricengines as in some branches of weaving in the coventry silk weaving industry the experiment of “cottage factories” was tried in the centre of a square surrounded by rows of cottages an enginehouse was built and the engine connected by shafts with the looms in the cottages in all cases the power was hired at so much per loom the rent was payable weekly whether the looms worked or not each cottage held from to looms some belonged to the weaver some were bought on credit some were hired the struggle between these cottage factories and the factory proper lasted over years it ended with the complete ruin of the cottage factories wherever the nature of the process did not involve production on a large scale the new industries that have sprung up in the last few decades such as envelope making steelpen making c have as a general rule first passed through the handicraft stage and then the manufacturing stage as short phases of transition to the factory stage the transition is very difficult in those cases where the production of the article by manufacture consists not of a series of graduated processes but of a great number of disconnected ones this circumstance formed a great hindrance to the establishment of steelpen factories nevertheless about years ago a machine was invented that automatically performed separate operations at once the first steelpens were supplied by the handicraft system in the year at £ s the gross in theywere supplied by manufacture at s and today the factory system supplies them to the trade at from to d the gross b reaction of the factory system on manufacture and domestic industries along with the development of the factory system and of the revolution in agriculture that accompanies it production in all the other branches of industry not only extends but alters its character the principle carried out in the factory system of analysing the process of production into its constituent phases and of solving the problems thus proposed by the application of mechanics of chemistry and of the whole range of the natural sciences becomes the determining principle everywhere hence machinery squeezes itself into the manufacturing industries first for one detail process then for another thus the solid crystal of their organisation based on the old division of labour becomes dissolved and makes way for constant changes independently of this a radical change takes place in the composition of the collective labourer a change of the persons working in combination in contrast with the manufacturing period the division of labour is thenceforth based wherever possible on the employment of women of children of all ages and of unskilled labourers in one word on cheap labour as it is characteristically called in england this is the case not only with all production on a large scale whether employing machinery or not but also with the socalled domestic industry whether carried on in the houses of the workpeople or in small workshops this modern socalled domestic industry has nothing except the name in common with the oldfashioned domestic industry the existence of which presupposes independent urban handicrafts independent peasant farming and above all a dwellinghouse for the labourer and his family that oldfashioned industry has now been converted into an outside department of the factory the manufactory or the warehouse besides the factory operatives the manufacturing workmen and the handicraftsman whom it concentrates in large masses at one spot and directly commands capital also sets in motion by means of invisible threads another army that of the workers in the domestic industries who dwell in the large towns and are also scattered over the face of the country an example the shirt factory of messrs tillie at londonderry which employs operatives in the factory itself and people spread up and down the country and working in their own houses the exploitation of cheap and immature labourpower is carried out in a more shameless manner in modern manufacture than in the factory proper this is because the technical foundation of the factory system namely the substitution of machines for muscular power and the light character of the labour is almost entirely absent in manufacture and at the same time women and overyoung children are subjected in a most unconscionable way to the influence of poisonous or injurious substances this exploitation is more shameless in the socalled domestic industry than in manufactures and that because the power of resistance in the labourers decreases with their dissemination because a whole series of plundering parasites insinuate themselves between the employer and the workman because a domestic industry has always to compete either with the factory system or with manufacturing in the same branch of production because poverty robs the workman of the conditions most essential to his labour of space light and ventilation because employment becomes more and more irregular and finally because in these the last resorts of the masses made “redundant” by modern industry and agriculture competition for work attains its maximum economy in the means of production first systematically carried out in the factory system and there from the very beginning coincident with the most reckless squandering of labourpower and robbery of the conditions normally requisite for labour – this economy now shows its antagonistic and murderous side more and more in a given branch of industry the less the social productive power of labour and the technical basis for a combination of processes are developed in that branch c modern manufacture i now proceed by a few examples to illustrate the principles laid down above as a matter of fact the reader is already familiar with numerous instances given in the chapter on the working day in the hardware manufactures of birmingham and the neighbourhood there are employed mostly in very heavy work children and young persons besides women there they are to be seen in the unwholesome brassfoundries button factories enamelling galvanising and lackering works owing to the excessive labour of their workpeople both adult and nonadult certain london houses where newspapers and books are printed have got the illomened name of “slaughterhouses” similar excesses are practised in bookbinding where the victims are chiefly women girls and children young persons have to do heavy work in ropewalks and nightwork in salt mines candle manufactories and chemical works young people are worked to death at turning the looms in silk weaving when it is not carried on by machinery one of the most shameful the most dirty and the worst paid kinds of labour and one on which women and young girls are by preference employed is the sorting of rags it is well known that great britain apart from its own immense store of rags is the emporium for the rag trade of the whole world they flow in from japan from the most remote states of south america and from the canary islands but the chief sources of their supply are germany france russia italy egypt turkey belgium and holland they are used for manure for making bedflocks for shoddy and they serve as the raw material of paper the ragsorters are the medium for the spread of smallpox and other infectious diseases and they themselves are the first victims a classical example of overwork of hard and inappropriate labour and of its brutalising effects on the workman from his childhood upwards is afforded not only by coalmining and miners generally but also by tile and brick making in which industry the recently invented machinery is in england used only here and there between may and september the work lasts from in the morning till in the evening and where the drying is done in the open air it often lasts from in the morning till in the evening work from in the morning till in the evening is considered “reduced” and “moderate” both boys and girls of and even of years of age are employed they work for the same number of hours often longer than the adults the work is hard and the summer heat increases the exhaustion in a certain tilefield at mosley eg a young woman years of age was in the habit of making tiles a day with the assistance of little girls who carried the clay for her and stacked the tiles these girls carried daily tons up the slippery sides of the clay pits from a depth of feet and then for a distance of feet “it is impossible for a child to pass through the purgatory of a tilefield without great moral degradation the low language which they are accustomed to hear from their tenderest years the filthy indecent and shameless habits amidst which unknowing and half wild they grow up make them in afterlife lawless abandoned dissolute a frightful source of demoralisation is the mode of living each moulder who is always a skilled labourer and the chief of a group supplies his subordinates with board and lodging in his cottage whether members of his family or not the men boys and girls all sleep in the cottage which contains generally two exceptionally rooms all on the ground floor and badly ventilated these people are so exhausted after the day’s hard work that neither the rules of health of cleanliness nor of decency are in the least observed many of these cottages are models of untidiness dirt and dust the greatest evil of the system that employs young girls on this sort of work consists in this that as a rule it chains them fast from childhood for the whole of their afterlife to the most abandoned rabble they become rough foulmouthed boys before nature has taught them that they are women clothed in a few dirty rags the legs naked far above the knees hair and face besmeared with dirt they learn to treat all feelings of decency and of shame with contempt during mealtimes they lie at full length in the fields or watch the boys bathing in a neighbouring canal their heavy day’s work at length completed they put on better clothes and accompany the men to the public houses” that excessive insobriety is prevalent from childhood upwards among the whole of this class is only natural “the worst is that the brickmakers despair of themselves you might as well said one of the better kind to a chaplain of southallfield try to raise and improve the devil as a brickie sir” as to the manner in which capital effects an economy in the requisites of labour in modern manufacture in which i include all workshops of larger size except factories proper official and most ample material bearing on it is to be found in the public health reports iv and vi the description of the workshops more especially those of the london printers and tailors surpasses the most loathsome phantasies of our romance writers the effect on the health of the workpeople is selfevident dr simon the chief medical officer of the privy council and the official editor of the “public health reports” says “in my fourth report i showed how it is practically impossible for the workpeople to insist upon that which is their first sanitary right viz the right that no matter what the work for which their employer brings them together the labour so far as it depends upon him should be freed from all avoidably unwholesome conditions i pointed out that while the workpeople are practically incapable of doing themselves this sanitary justice they are unable to obtain any effective support from the paid administrations of the sanitary police the life of myriads of workmen and workwomen is now uselessly tortured and shortened by the neverending physical suffering that their mere occupation begets” in illustration of the way in which the workrooms influence the state of health dr simon gives the following table of mortality number of persons of all ages in the respective industries industry compared as regards health deathrate per men in the respective industries between the stated ages age age age agriculture in england wales men women london tailors london printers d modern domestic industry i now come to the socalled domestic industry in order to get an idea of the horrors of this sphere in which capital conducts its exploitation in the background of modern mechanical industry one must go to the apparently quite idyllic trade of nailmaking carried on in a few remote villages of england in this place however it will be enough to give a few examples from those branches of the lacemaking and strawplaiting industries that are not yet carried on by the aid of machinery and that as yet do not compete with branches carried on in factories or in manufactories of the persons employed in england in the production of lace about fall under the authority of the factory act almost the whole of the remaining are women young persons and children of both sexes the male sex however being weakly represented the state of health of this cheap material for exploitation will be seen from the following table computed by dr trueman physician to the nottingham general dispensary out of female patients who were lacemakers most of them between the ages of and the number of consumptive ones were – in – in – in – in – in – in – in – in this progress in the rate of consumption ought to suffice for the most optimist of progressists and for the biggest hawker of lies among the freetrade bagmen of germany the factory act of regulates the actual making of the lace so far as it is done by machinery and this is the rule in england the branches that we are now about to examine solely with regard to those of the workpeople who work at home and not those who work in manufactories or warehouses fall into two divisions viz finishing mending the former gives the finishing touches to the machinemade lace and includes numerous subdivisions the lace finishing is done either in what are called “mistresses’ houses” or by women in their own houses with or without the help of their children the women who keep the “mistresses’ houses” are themselves poor the workroom is in a private house the mistresses take orders from manufacturers or from warehousemen and employ as many women girls and young children as the size of their rooms and the fluctuating demand of the business will allow the number of the workwomen employed in these workrooms varies from to in some and from to in others the average age at which the children commence work is six years but in many cases it is below five the usual workinghours are from in the morning till eight in the evening with ½ hours for meals which are taken at irregular intervals and often in the foul workrooms when business is brisk the labour frequently lasts from or even o’clock in the morning till or o’clock at night in english barracks the regulation space allotted to each soldier is cubic feet and in the military hospitals cubic feet but in those finishing sties there are but to cubic feet to each person at the same time the oxygen of the air is consumed by gaslights in order to keep the lace clean and although the floor is tiled or gagged the children are often compelled even in winter to pull off their shoes “it is not at all uncommon in nottingham to find to children huddled together in a small room of perhaps not more than feet square and employed for hours out of the at work that of itself is exhausting from its weariness and monotony and is besides carried on under every possible unwholesome condition even the very youngest children work with a strained attention and a rapidity that is astonishing hardly ever giving their fingers rest or glowering their motion if a question be asked them they never raise their eyes from their work from fear of losing a single moment” the “long stick” is used by the mistresses as a stimulant more and more as the working hours are prolonged “the children gradually tire and become as restless as birds towards the end of their long detention at an occupation that is monotonous eyestraining and exhausting from the uniformity in the posture of the body their work is like slavery” when women and their children work at home which nowadays means in a hired room often in a garret the state of things is if possible still worse this sort of work is given out within a circle of miles radius from nottingham on leaving the warehouses at or o’clock at night the children are often given a bundle of lace to take home with them and finish the pharisee of a capitalist represented by one of his servants accompanies this action of course with the unctuous phrase “that’s for mother” yet he knows well enough that the poor children must sit up and help pillow lacemaking is chiefly carried on in england in two agricultural districts one the honiton lace district extending from to miles along the south coast of devonshire and including a few places in north devon the other comprising a great part of the counties of buckingham bedford and northampton and also the adjoining portions of oxfordshire and huntingdonshire the cottages of the agricultural labourers are the places where the work is usually carried on many manufacturers employ upwards of of these lacemakers who are chiefly children and young persons of the female sex exclusively the state of things described as incidental to lace finishing is here repeated save that instead of the “mistresses’ houses” we find what are called “laceschools” kept by poor women in their cottages from their fifth year and often earlier until their twelfth or fifteenth year the children work in these schools during the first year the very young ones work from four to eight hours and later on from six in the morning till eight and ten o’clock at night “the rooms are generally the ordinary living rooms of small cottages the chimney stopped up to keep out draughts the inmates kept warm by their own animal heat alone and this frequently in winter in other cases these socalled schoolrooms are like small storerooms without fireplaces the overcrowding in these dens and the consequent vitiation of the air are often extreme added to this is the injurious effect of drains privies decomposing substances and other filth usual in the purlieus of the smaller cottages” with regard to space “in one laceschool girls and a mistress cubic feet to each person in another where the smell was unbearable persons and ½ cubic feet per head in this industry are to be found employed children of and ½ years” where lacemaking ends in the counties of buckingham and bedford strawplaiting begins and extends over a large part of hertfordshire and the westerly and northerly parts of essex in there were persons employed in strawplaiting and strawhat making of these were males of all ages the rest females of whom including about children were under years of age in the place of the laceschools we find here the “strawplait schools” the children commence their instruction in strawplaiting generally in their th often between their rd and th year education of course they get none the children themselves call the elementary schools “natural schools” to distinguish them from these bloodsucking institutions in which they are kept at work simply to get through the task generally yards daily prescribed by their halfstarved mothers these same mothers often make them work at home after school is over till and o’clock at night the straw cuts their mouths with which they constantly moisten it and their fingers dr ballard gives it as the general opinion of the whole body of medical officers in london that cubic feet is the minimum space proper for each person in a bedroom or workroom but in the strawplait schools space is more sparingly allotted than in the laceschools “ ½ and below cubic feet for each person” “the smaller of these numbers says one of the commissioners mr white represents less space than the half of what a child would occupy if packed in a box measuring feet in each direction” thus do the children enjoy life till the age of or the wretched halfstarved parents think of nothing but getting as much as possible out of their children the latter as soon as they are grown up do not care a farthing and naturally so for their parents and leave them “it is no wonder that ignorance and vice abound in a population so brought up their morality is at the lowest ebb a great number of the women have illegitimate children and that at such an immature age that even those most conversant with criminal statistics are astounded” and the native land of these model families is the pattern christian country for europe so says at least count montalembert certainly a competent authority on christianity wages in the above industries miserable as they are the maximum wages of a child in the strawplait schools rising in rare cases to shillings are reduced far below their nominal amount by the prevalence of the truck system everywhere but especially in the lace districts e passage of modern manufacture and domestic industry into modern mechanical industry the hastening of this revolution by the application of the factory acts to those industries the cheapening of labourpower by sheer abuse of the labour of women and children by sheer robbery of every normal condition requisite for working and living and by the sheer brutality of overwork and nightwork meets at last with natural obstacles that cannot be overstepped so also when based on these methods do the cheapening of commodities and capitalist exploitation in general so soon as this point is at last reached – and it takes many years – the hour has struck for the introduction of machinery and for the thenceforth rapid conversion of the scattered domestic industries and also of manufactures into factory industries an example on the most colossal scale of this movement is afforded by the production of wearing apparel this industry according to the classification of the children’s employment commission comprises strawhat makers ladies’hat makers capmakers tailors milliners and dressmakers shirtmakers corsetmakers glovemakers shoemakers besides many minor branches such as the making of neckties collars c in the number of females employed in these industries in england and wales amounted to of these at the least were under and under years of age the number of these workwomen in the united kingdom in was the number of males employed in england and wales in hatmaking shoemaking glovemaking and tailoring was of these under years between and and over years many of the smaller branches are not included in these figures but take the figures as they stand we then have for england and wales alone according to the census of a total of persons about as many as are absorbed by agriculture and cattle breeding we begin to understand what becomes of the immense quantities of goods conjured up by the magic of machinery and of the enormous masses of workpeople which that machinery sets free the production of wearing apparel is carried on partly in manufactories in whose workrooms there is but a reproduction of that division of labour the membra disjecta of which were found ready to hand partly by small masterhandicraftsmen these however do not as formerly work for individual consumers but for manufactories and warehouses and to such an extent that often whole towns and stretches of country carry on certain branches such as shoemaking as a speciality finally on a very great scale by the socalled domestic workers who form an external department of the manufactories warehouses and even of the workshops of the smaller masters the raw material c is supplied by mechanical industry the mass of cheap human material taillable à merci et miséricorde is composed of the individuals “liberated” by mechanical industry and improved agriculture the manufactures of this class owed their origin chiefly to the capitalist’s need of having at hand an army ready equipped to meet any increase of demand these manufactures nevertheless allowed the scattered handicrafts and domestic industries to continue to exist as a broad foundation the great production of surplusvalue in these branches of labour and the progressive cheapening of their articles were and are chiefly due to the minimum wages paid no more than requisite for a miserable vegetation and to the extension of workingtime up to the maximum endurable by the human organism it was in fact by the cheapness of the human sweat and the human blood which were converted into commodities that the markets were constantly being extended and continue daily to be extended more especially was this the case with england’s colonial markets where besides english tastes and habits prevail at last the critical point was reached the basis of the old method sheer brutality in the exploitation of the workpeople accompanied more or less by a systematic division of labour no longer sufficed for the extending markets and for the still more rapidly extending competition of the capitalists the hour struck for the advent of machinery the decisively revolutionary machine the machine which attacks in an equal degree the whole of the numberless branches of this sphere of production dressmaking tailoring shoemaking sewing hatmaking and many others is the sewingmachine its immediate effect on the workpeople is like that of all machinery which since the rise of modern industry has seized upon new branches of trade children of too tender an age are sent adrift the wage of the machine hands rises compared with that of the houseworkers many of whom belong to the poorest of the poor that of the better situated handicraftsman with whom the machine competes sinks the new machine hands are exclusively girls and young women with the help of mechanical force they destroy the monopoly that male labour had of the heavier work and they drive off from the lighter work numbers of old women and very young children the overpowering competition crushes the weakest of the manual labourers the fearful increase in death from starvation during the last years in london runs parallel with the extension of machine sewing the new workwomen turn the machines by hand and foot or by hand alone sometimes sitting sometimes standing according to the weight size and special make of the machine and expend a great deal of labourpower their occupation is unwholesome owing to the long hours although in most cases they are not so long as under the old system wherever the sewingmachine locates itself in narrow and already overcrowded workrooms it adds to the unwholesome influences “the effect” says mr lord “on entering lowceiled workrooms in which to machine hands are working is unbearable the heat partly due to the gas stoves used for warming the irons is horrible even when moderate hours of work ie from in the morning till in the evening prevail in such places yet or persons fall into a swoon regularly every day” the revolution in the industrial methods which is the necessary result of the revolution in the instruments of production is effected by a medley of transition forms these forms vary according to the extent to which the sewingmachine has become prevalent in one branch of industry or the other to the time during which it has been in operation to the previous condition of the workpeople to the preponderance of manufacture of handicrafts or of domestic industry to the rent of the workrooms c in dressmaking for instance where the labour for the most part was already organised chiefly by simple cooperation the sewingmachine at first formed merely a new factor in that manufacturing industry in tailoring shirtmaking shoemaking c all the forms are intermingled here the factory system proper there middlemen receive the raw material from the capitalist en chef and group around their sewingmachines in “chambers” and “garrets” from to or more workwomen finally as is always the case with machinery when not organised into a system and when it can also be used in dwarfish proportions handicraftsman and domestic workers along with their families or with a little extra labour from without make use of their own sewingmachines the system actually prevalent in england is that the capitalist concentrates a large number of machines on his premises and then distributes the produce of those machines for further manipulation amongst the domestic workers the variety of the transition forms however does not conceal the tendency to conversion into the factory system proper this tendency is nurtured by the very nature of the sewingmachine the manifold uses of which push on the concentration under one roof and one management of previously separated branches of a trade it is also favoured by the circumstance that preparatory needlework and certain other operations are most conveniently done on the premises where the machine is at work as well as by the inevitable expropriation of the hand sewers and of the domestic workers who work with their own machines this fate has already in part overtaken them the constantly increasing amount of capital invested in sewingmachines gives the spur to the production of and gluts the markets with machinemade articles thereby giving the signal to the domestic workers for the sale of their machines the overproduction of sewingmachines themselves causes their producers in bad want of a sale to let them out for so much a week thus crushing by their deadly competition the small owners of machines constant changes in the construction of the machines and their everincreasing cheapness depreciate day by day the older makes and allow of their being sold in great numbers at absurd prices to large capitalists who alone can thus employ them at a profit finally the substitution of the steamengine for man gives in this as in all similar revolutions the finishing blow at first the use of steam power meets with mere technical difficulties such as unsteadiness in the machines difficulty in controlling their speed rapid wear and tear of the lighter machines c all of which are soon overcome by experience if on the one hand the concentration of many machines in large manufactories leads to the use of steam power on the other hand the competition of steam with human muscles hastens on the concentration of workpeople and machines in large factories thus england is at present experiencing not only in the colossal industry of making wearing apparel but in most of the other trades mentioned above the conversion of manufacture of handicrafts and of domestic work into the factory system after each of those forms of production totally changed and disorganised under the influence of modern industry has long ago reproduced and even overdone all the horrors of the factory system without participating in any of the elements of social progress it contains this industrial revolution which takes place spontaneously is artificially helped on by the extension of the factory acts to all industries in which women young persons and children are employed the compulsory regulation of the working day as regards its length pauses beginning and end the system of relays of children the exclusion of all children under a certain age c necessitate on the one hand more machinery and the substitution of steam as a motive power in the place of muscles on the other hand in order to make up for the loss of time an expansion occurs of the means of production used in common of the furnaces buildings c in one word greater concentration of the means of production and a correspondingly greater concourse of workpeople the chief objection repeatedly and passionately urged on behalf of each manufacture threatened with the factory act is in fact this that in order to continue the business on the old scale a greater outlay of capital will be necessary but as regards labour in the socalled domestic industries and the intermediate forms between them and manufacture so soon as limits are put to the working day and to the employment of children those industries go to the wall unlimited exploitation of cheap labourpower is the sole foundation of their power to compete one of the essential conditions for the existence of the factory system especially when the length of the working day is fixed is certainty in the result ie the production in a given time of a given quantity of commodities or of a given useful effect the statutory pauses in the working day moreover imply the assumption that periodical and sudden cessation of the work does no harm to the article undergoing the process of production this certainty in the result and this possibility of interrupting the work are of course easier to be attained in the purely mechanical industries than in those in which chemical and physical processes play a part as for instance in the earthenware trade in bleaching dyeing baking and in most of the metal industries wherever there is a workingday without restriction as to length wherever there is nightwork and unrestricted waste of human life there the slightest obstacle presented by the nature of the work to a change for the better is soon looked upon as an everlasting barrier erected by nature no poison kills vermin with more certainty than the factory act removes such everlasting barriers no one made a greater outcry over “impossibilities” than our friends the earthenware manufacturers in however they were brought under the act and within sixteen months every “impossibility” had vanished “the improved method” called forth by the act “of making slip by pressure instead of by evaporation the newlyconstructed stoves for drying the ware in its green state c are each events of great importance in the pottery art and mark an advance which the preceding century could not rival it has even considerably reduced the temperature of the stoves themselves with a considerable saving of fuel and with a readier effect on the ware” in spite of every prophecy the costprice of earthenware did not rise but the quantity produced did and to such an extent that the export for the twelve months ending december exceeded in value by £ the average of the preceding three years in the manufacture of matches it was thought to be an indispensable requirement that boys even while bolting their dinner should go on dipping the matches in melted phosphorus the poisonous vapour from which rose into their faces the factory act made the saving of time a necessity and so forced into existence a dipping machine the vapour from which could not come in contact with the workers so at the present time in those branches of the lace manufacture not yet subject to the factory act it is maintained that the mealtimes cannot be regular owing to the different periods required by the various kinds of lace for drying which periods vary from three minutes up to an hour and more to this the children’s employment commissioners answer “the circumstances of this case are precisely analogous to that of the paperstainers dealt with in our first report some of the principal manufacturers in the trade urged that in consequence of the nature of the materials used and their various processes they would be unable without serious loss to stop for mealtimes at any given moment but it was seen from the evidence that by due care and previous arrangement the apprehended difficulty would be got over and accordingly by clause of section of the factory acts extension act passed during this session of parliament an interval of eighteen months is given to them from the passing of the act before they are required to conform to the meal hours specified by the factory acts” hardly had the act been passed when our friends the manufacturers found out “the inconveniences we expected to arise from the introduction of the factory acts into our branch of manufacture i am happy to say have not arisen we do not find the production at all interfered with in short we produce more in the same time” it is evident that the english legislature which certainly no one will venture to reproach with being overdosed with genius has been led by experience to the conclusion that a simple compulsory law is sufficient to enact away all the socalled impediments opposed by the nature of the process to the restriction and regulation of the working day hence on the introduction of the factory act into a given industry a period varying from six to eighteen months is fixed within which it is incumbent on the manufacturers to remove all technical impediments to the working of the act mirabeau’s “impossible ne me dites jamais ce bête de mot” is particularly applicable to modern technology but though the factory acts thus artificially ripen the material elements necessary for the conversion of the manufacturing system into the factory system yet at the same time owing to the necessity they impose for greater outlay of capital they hasten on the decline of the small masters and the concentration of capital besides the purely technical impediments that are removable by technical means the irregular habits of the workpeople themselves obstruct the regulation of the hours of labour this is especially the case where piecewage predominates and where loss of time in one part of the day or week can be made good by subsequent overtime or by nightwork a process which brutalises the adult workman and ruins his wife and children although this absence of regularity in the expenditure of labourpower is a natural and rude reaction against the tedium of monotonous drudgery it originates also to a much greater degree from anarchy in production anarchy that in its turn presupposes unbridled exploitation of labourpower by the capitalist besides the general periodic changes of the industrial cycle and the special fluctuations in the markets to which each industry is subject we may also reckon what is called “the season” dependent either on the periodicity of favourable seasons of the year for navigation or on fashion and the sudden placing of large orders that have to be executed in the shortest possible time the habit of giving such orders becomes more frequent with the extension of railways and telegraphs “the extension of the railway system throughout the country has tended very much to encourage giving short notice purchasers now come up from glasgow manchester and edinburgh once every fortnight or so to the wholesale city warehouses which we supply and give small orders requiring immediate execution instead of buying from stock as they used to do years ago we were always able to work in the slack times so as to meet demand of the next season but now no one can say beforehand what will be the demand then” in those factories and manufactories that are not yet subject to the factory acts the most fearful overwork prevails periodically during what is called the season in consequence of sudden orders in the outside department of the factory of the manufactory and of the warehouse the socalled domestic workers whose employment is at the best irregular are entirely dependent for their raw material and their orders on the caprice of the capitalist who in this industry is not hampered by any regard for depreciation of his buildings and machinery and risks nothing by a stoppage of work but the skin of the worker himself here then he sets himself systematically to work to form an industrial reserve force that shall be ready at a moment’s notice during one part of the year he decimates this force by the most inhuman toil during the other part he lets it starve for want of work “the employers avail themselves of the habitual irregularity in the homework when any extra work is wanted at a push so that the work goes on till and pm or am or as the usual phrase is “all hours” and that in localities where “the stench is enough to knock you down you go to the door perhaps and open it but shudder to go further” “they are curious men” said one of the witnesses a shoemaker speaking of the masters “they think it does a boy no harm to work too hard for half the year if he is nearly idle for the other half” in the same way as technical impediments so too those “usages which have grown with the growth of trade” were and still are proclaimed by interested capitalists as obstacles due to the nature of the work this was a favourite cry of the cotton lords at the time they were first threatened with the factory acts although their industry more than any other depends on navigation yet experience has given them the lie since then every pretended obstruction to business has been treated by the factory inspectors as a mere sham the thoroughly conscientious investigations of the children’s employment commission prove that the effect of the regulation of the hours of work in some industries was to spread the mass of labour previously employed more evenly over the whole year that this regulation was the first rational bridle on the murderous meaningless caprices of fashion caprices that consort so badly with the system of modern industry that the development of ocean navigation and of the means of communication generally has swept away the technical basis on which seasonwork was really supported and that all other socalled unconquerable difficulties vanish before larger buildings additional machinery increase in the number of workpeople employed and the alterations caused by all these in the mode of conducting the wholesale trade but for all that capital never becomes reconciled to such changes – and this is admitted over and over again by its own representatives – except “under the pressure of a general act of parliament” for the compulsory regulation of the hours of labour section the factory acts sanitary and educational clauses of the same their general extension in england factory legislation that first conscious and methodical reaction of society against the spontaneously developed form of the process of production is as we have seen just as much the necessary product of modern industry as cotton yarn selfactors and the electric telegraph before passing to the consideration of the extension of that legislation in england we shall shortly notice certain clauses contained in the factory acts and not relating to the hours of work apart from their wording which makes it easy for the capitalist to evade them the sanitary clauses are extremely meagre and in fact limited to provisions for whitewashing the walls for insuring cleanliness in some other matters for ventilation and for protection against dangerous machinery in the third book we shall return again to the fanatical opposition of the masters to those clauses which imposed upon them a slight expenditure on appliances for protecting the limbs of their workpeople an opposition that throws a fresh and glaring light on the freetrade dogma according to which in a society with conflicting interests each individual necessarily furthers the common weal by seeking nothing but his own personal advantage one example is enough the reader knows that during the last years the flax industry has very much extended and that with that extension the number of scutching mills in ireland has increased in there were in that country of these mills regularly in autumn and winter women and “young persons” the wives sons and daughters of the neighbouring small farmers a class of people totally unaccustomed to machinery are taken from field labour to feed the rollers of the scutching mills with flax the accidents both as regards number and kind are wholly unexampled in the history of machinery in one scutching mill at kildinan near cork there occurred between and six fatal accidents and sixty mutilations every one of which might have been prevented by the simplest appliances at the cost of a few shillings dr w white the certifying surgeon for factories at downpatrick states in his official report dated the th december “the serious accidents at the scutching mills are of the most fearful nature in many cases a quarter of the body is torn from the trunk and either involves death or a future of wretched incapacity and suffering the increase of mills in the country will of course extend these dreadful results and it will be a great boon if they are brought under the legislature i am convinced that by proper supervision of scutching mills a vast sacrifice of life and limb would be averted” what could possibly show better the character of the capitalist mode of production than the necessity that exists for forcing upon it by acts of parliament the simplest appliances for maintaining cleanliness and health in the potteries the factory act of “has whitewashed and cleansed upwards of workshops after a period of abstinence from any such cleaning in many cases of years and in some entirely” this is the “abstinence” of the capitalist “in which were employed artisans hitherto breathing through protracted days and often nights of labour a mephitic atmosphere and which rendered an otherwise comparatively innocuous occupation pregnant with disease and death the act has improved the ventilation very much” at the same time this portion of the act strikingly shows that the capitalist mode of production owing to its very nature excludes all rational improvement beyond a certain point it has been stated over and over again that the english doctors are unanimous in declaring that where the work is continuous cubic feet is the very least space that should be allowed for each person now if the factory acts owing to their compulsory provisions indirectly hasten on the conversion of small workshops into factories thus indirectly attacking the proprietary rights of the smaller capitalists and assuring a monopoly to the great ones so if it were made obligatory to provide the proper space for each workman in every workshop thousands of small employers would at one full swoop be expropriated directly the very root of the capitalist mode of production ie the selfexpansion of all capital large or small by means of the “free” purchase and consumption of labourpower would be attacked factory legislation is therefore brought to a deadlock before these cubic feet of breathing space the sanitary officers the industrial inquiry commissioners the factory inspectors all harp over and over again upon the necessity for those cubic feet and upon the impossibility of wringing them out of capital they thus in fact declare that consumption and other lung diseases among the workpeople are necessary conditions to the existence of capital paltry as the education clauses of the act appear on the whole yet they proclaim elementary education to be an indispensable condition to the employment of children the success of those clauses proved for the first time the possibility of combining education and gymnastics with manual labour and consequently of combining manual labour with education and gymnastics the factory inspectors soon found out by questioning the schoolmasters that the factory children although receiving only one half the education of the regular day scholars yet learnt quite as much and often more “this can be accounted for by the simple fact that with only being at school for one half of the day they are always fresh and nearly always ready and willing to receive instruction the system on which they work half manual labour and half school renders each employment a rest and a relief to the other consequently both are far more congenial to the child than would be the case were he kept constantly at one it is quite clear that a boy who has been at school all the morning cannot in hot weather particularly cope with one who comes fresh and bright from his work” further information on this point will be found in senior’s speech at the social science congress at edinburgh in he there shows amongst other things how the monotonous and uselessly long school hours of the children of the upper and middle classes uselessly add to the labour of the teacher “while he not only fruitlessly but absolutely injuriously wastes the time health and energy of the children” from the factory system budded as robert owen has shown us in detail the germ of the education of the future an education that will in the case of every child over a given age combine productive labour with instruction and gymnastics not only as one of the methods of adding to the efficiency of production but as the only method of producing fully developed human beings modern industry as we have seen sweeps away by technical means the manufacturing division of labour under which each man is bound hand and foot for life to a single detailoperation at the same time the capitalistic form of that industry reproduces this same division of labour in a still more monstrous shape in the factory proper by converting the workman into a living appendage of the machine and everywhere outside the factory partly by the sporadic use of machinery and machine workers partly by reestablishing the division of labour on a fresh basis by the general introduction of the labour of women and children and of cheap unskilled labour the antagonism between the manufacturing division of labour and the methods of modern industry makes itself forcibly felt it manifests itself amongst other ways in the frightful fact that a great part of the children employed in modern factories and manufactures are from their earliest years riveted to the most simple manipulations and exploited for years without being taught a single sort of work that would afterwards make them of use even in the same manufactory or factory in the english letterpress printing trade for example there existed formerly a system corresponding to that in the old manufactures and handicrafts of advancing the apprentices from easy to more and more difficult work they went through a course of teaching till they were finished printers to be able to read and write was for every one of them a requirement of their trade all this was changed by the printing machine it employs two sorts of labourers one grown up renters the other boys mostly from to years of age whose sole business is either to spread the sheets of paper under the machine or to take from it the printed sheets they perform this weary task in london especially for and hours at a stretch during several days in the week and frequently for hours with only hours’ rest for meals and sleep a great part of them cannot read and they are as a rule utter savages and very extraordinary creatures “to qualify them for the work which they have to do they require no intellectual training there is little room in it for skill and less for judgment their wages though rather high for boys do not increase proportionately as they grow up and the majority of them cannot look for advancement to the better paid and more responsible post of machine minder because while each machine has but one minder it has at least two and often four boys attached to it” as soon as they get too old for such child’s work that is about at the latest they are discharged from the printing establishments they become recruits of crime several attempts to procure them employment elsewhere were rendered of no avail by their ignorance and brutality and by their mental and bodily degradation as with the division of labour in the interior of the manufacturing workshops so it is with the division of labour in the interior of society so long as handicraft and manufacture form the general groundwork of social production the subjection of the producer to one branch exclusively the breaking up of the multifariousness of his employment is a necessary step in the development on that groundwork each separate branch of production acquires empirically the form that is technically suited to it slowly perfects it and so soon as a given degree of maturity has been reached rapidly crystallises that form the only thing that here and there causes a change besides new raw material supplied by commerce is the gradual alteration of the instruments of labour but their form too once definitely settled by experience petrifies as is proved by their being in many cases handed down in the same form by one generation to another during thousands of years a characteristic feature is that even down into the eighteenth century the different trades were called “mysteries” mystères into their secrets none but those duly initiated could penetrate modern industry rent the veil that concealed from men their own social process of production and that turned the various spontaneously divided branches of production into so many riddles not only to outsiders but even to the initiated the principle which it pursued of resolving each process into its constituent movements without any regard to their possible execution by the hand of man created the new modern science of technology the varied apparently unconnected and petrified forms of the industrial processes now resolved themselves into so many conscious and systematic applications of natural science to the attainment of given useful effects technology also discovered the few main fundamental forms of motion which despite the diversity of the instruments used are necessarily taken by every productive action of the human body just as the science of mechanics sees in the most complicated machinery nothing but the continual repetition of the simple mechanical powers modern industry never looks upon and treats the existing form of a process as final the technical basis of that industry is therefore revolutionary while all earlier modes of production were essentially conservative by means of machinery chemical processes and other methods it is continually causing changes not only in the technical basis of production but also in the functions of the labourer and in the social combinations of the labourprocess at the same time it thereby also revolutionises the division of labour within the society and incessantly launches masses of capital and of workpeople from one branch of production to another but if modern industry by its very nature therefore necessitates variation of labour fluency of function universal mobility of the labourer on the other hand in its capitalistic form it reproduces the old division of labour with its ossified particularisations we have seen how this absolute contradiction between the technical necessities of modern industry and the social character inherent in its capitalistic form dispels all fixity and security in the situation of the labourer how it constantly threatens by taking away the instruments of labour to snatch from his hands his means of subsistence and by suppressing his detailfunction to make him superfluous we have seen too how this antagonism vents its rage in the creation of that monstrosity an industrial reserve army kept in misery in order to be always at the disposal of capital in the incessant human sacrifices from among the workingclass in the most reckless squandering of labourpower and in the devastation caused by a social anarchy which turns every economic progress into a social calamity this is the negative side but if on the one hand variation of work at present imposes itself after the manner of an overpowering natural law and with the blindly destructive action of a natural law that meets with resistance at all points modern industry on the other hand through its catastrophes imposes the necessity of recognising as a fundamental law of production variation of work consequently fitness of the labourer for varied work consequently the greatest possible development of his varied aptitudes it becomes a question of life and death for society to adapt the mode of production to the normal functioning of this law modern industry indeed compels society under penalty of death to replace the detailworker of today grappled by lifelong repetition of one and the same trivial operation and thus reduced to the mere fragment of a man by the fully developed individual fit for a variety of labours ready to face any change of production and to whom the different social functions he performs are but so many modes of giving free scope to his own natural and acquired powers one step already spontaneously taken towards effecting this revolution is the establishment of technical and agricultural schools and of “écoles d’enseignement professionnel” in which the children of the workingmen receive some little instruction in technology and in the practical handling of the various implements of labour though the factory act that first and meagre concession wrung from capital is limited to combining elementary education with work in the factory there can be no doubt that when the workingclass comes into power as inevitably it must technical instruction both theoretical and practical will take its proper place in the workingclass schools there is also no doubt that such revolutionary ferments the final result of which is the abolition of the old division of labour are diametrically opposed to the capitalistic form of production and to the economic status of the labourer corresponding to that form but the historical development of the antagonisms immanent in a given form of production is the only way in which that form of production can be dissolved and a new form established “ne sutor ultra crepidam” – this nec plus ultra of handicraft wisdom became sheer nonsense from the moment the watchmaker watt invented the steamengine the barber arkwright the throstle and the workingjeweller fulton the steamship so long as factory legislation is confined to regulating the labour in factories manufactories c it is regarded as a mere interference with the exploiting rights of capital but when it comes to regulating the socalled “homelabour” it is immediately viewed as a direct attack on the patria potestas on parental authority the tenderhearted english parliament long affected to shrink from taking this step the force of facts however compelled it at last to acknowledge that modern industry in overturning the economic foundation on which was based the traditional family and the family labour corresponding to it had also unloosened all traditional family ties the rights of the children had to be proclaimed the final report of the ch empl comm of states “it is unhappily to a painful degree apparent throughout the whole of the evidence that against no persons do the children of both sexes so much require protection as against their parents” the system of unlimited exploitation of children’s labour in general and the socalled homelabour in particular is maintained only because the parents are able without check or control to exercise this arbitrary and mischievous power over their young and tender offspring parents must not possess the absolute power of making their children mere ‘machines to earn so much weekly wage’ the children and young persons therefore in all such cases may justifiably claim from the legislature as a natural right that an exemption should be secured to them from what destroys prematurely their physical strength and lowers them in the scale of intellectual and moral beings” it was not however the misuse of parental authority that created the capitalistic exploitation whether direct or indirect of children’s labour but on the contrary it was the capitalistic mode of exploitation which by sweeping away the economic basis of parental authority made its exercise degenerate into a mischievous misuse of power however terrible and disgusting the dissolution under the capitalist system of the old family ties may appear nevertheless modern industry by assigning as it does an important part in the process of production outside the domestic sphere to women to young persons and to children of both sexes creates a new economic foundation for a higher form of the family and of the relations between the sexes it is of course just as absurd to hold the teutonicchristian form of the family to be absolute and final as it would be to apply that character to the ancient roman the ancient greek or the eastern forms which moreover taken together form a series in historical development moreover it is obvious that the fact of the collective working group being composed of individuals of both sexes and all ages must necessarily under suitable conditions become a source of humane development although in its spontaneously developed brutal capitalistic form where the labourer exists for the process of production and not the process of production for the labourer that fact is a pestiferous source of corruption and slavery the necessity for a generalisation of the factory acts for transforming them from an exceptional law relating to mechanical spinning and weaving – those first creations of machinery – into a law affecting social production as a whole arose as we have seen from the mode in which modern industry was historically developed in the rear of that industry the traditional form of manufacture of handicraft and of domestic industry is entirely revolutionised manufactures are constantly passing into the factory system and handicrafts into manufactures and lastly the spheres of handicraft and of the domestic industries become in a comparatively speaking wonderfully short time dens of misery in which capitalistic exploitation obtains free play for the wildest excesses there are two circumstances that finally turn the scale first the constantly recurring experience that capital so soon as it finds itself subject to legal control at one point compensates itself all the more recklessly at other points secondly the cry of the capitalists for equality in the conditions of competition ie for equal restrain on all exploitation of labour on this point let us listen to two heartbroken cries messrs cooksley of bristol nail and chain c manufacturers spontaneously introduced the regulations of the factory act into their business “as the old irregular system prevails in neighbouring works the messrs cooksley are subject to the disadvantage of having their boys enticed to continue their labour elsewhere after pm ‘this’ they naturally say ‘is an unjustice and loss to us as it exhausts a portion of the boy’s strength of which we ought to have the full benefit’” mr j simpson paper box and bagmaker london states before the commissioners of the ch empl comm “he would sign any petition for it” legislative interference “as it was he always felt restless at night when he had closed his place lest others should be working later than him and getting away his orders” summarising the ch empl comm says “it would be unjust to the larger employers that their factories should be placed under regulation while the hours of labour in the smaller places in their own branch of business were under no legislative restriction and to the injustice arising from the unfair conditions of competition in regard to hours that would be created if the smaller places of work were exempt would be added the disadvantage to the larger manufacturers of finding their supply of juvenile and female labour drawn off to the places of work exempt from legislation further a stimulus would be given to the multiplication of the smaller places of work which are almost invariably the least favourable to the health comfort education and general improvement of the people” in its final report the commission proposes to subject to the factory act more than children young persons and women of which number about one half are exploited in small industries and by the socalled homework it says “but if it should seem fit to parliament to place the whole of that large number of children young persons and females under the protective legislation above adverted to it cannot be doubted that such legislation would have a most beneficent effect not only upon the young and the feeble who are its more immediate objects but upon the still larger body of adult workers who would in all these employments both directly and indirectly come immediately under its influence it would enforce upon them regular and moderate hours it would lead to their places of work being kept in a healthy and cleanly state it would therefore husband and improve that store of physical strength on which their own wellbeing and that of the country so much depends it would save the rising generation from that overexertion at an early age which undermines their constitutions and leads to premature decay finally it would ensure them – at least up to the age of – the opportunity of receiving the elements of education and would put an end to that utter ignorance so faithfully exhibited in the reports of our assistant commissioners and which cannot be regarded without the deepest pain and a profound sense of national degradation” the tory cabinet announced in the speech from the throne on february that it had framed the proposals of the industrial commission of inquiry into bills to get that far another twenty years of experimentum in corpore vili had been required already in a parliamentary commission of inquiry on the labour of children had been appointed its report in unfolded in the words of nassau w senior “the most frightful picture of avarice selfishness and cruelty on the part of masters and of parents and of juvenile and infantile misery degradation and destruction ever presented it may be supposed that it describes the horrors of a past age but there is unhappily evidence that those horrors continue as intense as they were a pamphlet published by hardwicke about years ago states that the abuses complained of in are in full bloom at the present day it is a strange proof of the general neglect of the morals and health of the children of the workingclass that this report lay unnoticed for years during which the children ‘bred up without the remotest sign of comprehension as to what is meant by the term morals who had neither knowledge nor religion nor natural affection’ were allowed to become the parents of the present generation” the social conditions having undergone a change parliament could not venture to shelve the demands of the commission of as it had done those of the commission of hence in when the commission had not yet published more than a part of its reports the earthenware industries including the potteries makers of paperhangings matches cartridges and caps and fustian cutters were made subject to the acts in force in the textile industries in the speech from the throne on th february the tory cabinet of the day announced the introduction of bills founded on the final recommendations of the commission which had completed its labours in on the th august the factory acts extension act and on the st august the workshops’ regulation act received the royal assent the former act having reference to large industries the latter to small the former applies to blastfurnaces iron’ and copper mills foundries machine shops metal manufactories guttapercha works paper mills glassworks tobacco manufactories letterpress printing including newspapers bookbinding in short to all industrial establishments of the above kind in which individuals or more are occupied simultaneously and for not less than days during the year to give an idea of the extent of the sphere embraced by the workshops’ regulation act in its application we cite from its interpretation clause the following passages “handicraft shall mean any manual labour exercised by way of trade or for purposes of gain in or incidental to the making any article or part of an article or in or incidental to the altering repairing ornamenting finishing or otherwise adapting for sale any article” “workshop shall mean any room or place whatever in the open air or undercover in which any handicraft is carried on by any child young person or woman and to which and over which the person by whom such child young person or woman is employed has the right of access and control” “employed shall mean occupied in any handicraft whether for wages or not under a master or under a parent as herein defined” “parent shall mean parent guardian or person having the custody of or control over any child or young person” clause which imposes a penalty for employment of children young persons and women contrary to the provisions of the act subjects to fines not only the occupier of the workshop whether parent or not but even “the parent of or the person deriving any direct benefit from the labour of or having the control over the child young person or woman” the factory acts extension act which affects the large establishments derogates from the factory act by a crowd of vicious exceptions and cowardly compromises with the masters the workshops’ regulation act wretched in all its details remained a dead letter in the hands of the municipal and local authorities who were charged with its execution when in parliament withdrew from them this power in order to confer it on the factory inspectors to whose province it thus added by a single stroke more than one hundred thousand workshops and three hundred brickworks care was taken at the same time not to add more than eight assistants to their already undermanned staff what strikes us then in the english legislation of is on the one hand the necessity imposed on the parliament of the ruling classes of adopting in principle measures so extraordinary and on so great a scale against the excesses of capitalistic exploitation and on the other hand the hesitation the repugnance and the bad faith with which it lent itself to the task of carrying those measures into practice the inquiry commission of also proposed a new regulation of the mining industry an industry distinguished from others by the exceptional characteristic that the interests of landlord and capitalist there join hands the antagonism of these two interests had been favourable to factory legislation while on the other hand the absence of that antagonism is sufficient to explain the delays and chicanery of the legislation on mines the inquiry commission of had made revelations so terrible so shocking and creating such a scandal all over europe that to salve its conscience parliament passed the mining act of in which it limited itself to forbidding the employment underground in mines of children under years of age and females then another act the mines’ inspecting act of provides that mines shall be inspected by public officers nominated specially for that purpose and that boys between the ages of and years shall not be employed unless they have a school certificate or go to school for a certain number of hours this act was a complete dead letter owing to the ridiculously small number of inspectors the meagreness of their powers and other causes that will become apparent as we proceed one of the most recent blue books on mines is the “report from the select committee on mines together with c evidence rd july ” this report is the work of a parliamentary committee selected from members of the house of commons and authorised to summon and examine witnesses it is a thick folio volume in which the report itself occupies only five lines to this effect that the committee has nothing to say and that more witnesses must be examined the mode of examining the witnesses reminds one of the crossexamination of witnesses in english courts of justice where the advocate tries by means of impudent unexpected equivocal and involved questions put without connexion to intimidate surprise and confound the witness and to give a forced meaning to the answers extorted from him in this inquiry the members of the committee themselves are the crossexaminers and among them are to be found both mineowners and mine exploiters the witnesses are mostly working coal miners the whole farce is too characteristic of the spirit of capital not to call for a few extracts from this report for the sake of conciseness i have classified them i may also add that every question and its answer are numbered in the english blue books employment in mines of boys of years and upwards – in the mines the work inclusive of going and returning usually lasts or hours sometimes even from and o’clock am till and o’clock pm n the adults work in two shifts of eight hours each but there is no alternation with the boys on account of the expense n the younger boys are chiefly employed in opening and shutting the ventilating doors in the various parts of the mine the older ones are employed on heavier work in carrying coal c n they work these long hours underground until their th or nd year when they are put to miner’s work proper n children and young persons are at present worse treated and harder worked than at any previous period n the miners demand almost unanimously an act of parliament prohibiting the employment in mines of children under and now hussey vivian himself an exploiter of mines asks “would not the opinion of the workman depend upon the poverty of the workman’s family” mr bruce “do you not think it would be a very hard case where a parent had been injured or where he was sickly or where a father was dead and there was only a mother to prevent a child between and earning s d a day for the good of the family you must lay down a general rule are you prepared to recommend legislation which would prevent the employment of children under and whatever the state of their parents might be” “yes” ns vivian “supposing that an enactment were passed preventing the employment of children under the age of would it not be probable that the parents of children would seek employment for their children in other directions for instance in manufacture” “not generally i think” n kinnaird “some of the boys are keepers of doors” “yes” “is there not generally a very great draught every time you open a door or close it” “yes generally there is” “it sounds a very easy thing but it is in fact rather a painful one” “he is imprisoned there just the same as if he was in a cell of a gaol” bourgeois vivian “whenever a boy is furnished with a lamp cannot he read” “yes he can read if he finds himself in candles i suppose he would be found fault with if he were discovered reading he is there to mind his business he has a duty to perform and he has to attend to it in the first place and i do not think it would be allowed down the pit” ns ii education – the working miners want a law for the compulsory education of their children as in factories they declare the clauses of the act of which require a school certificate to be obtained before employing boys of and years of age to be quite illusory the examination of the witnesses on this subject is truly droll “is it the act required more against the masters or against the parents” “it is required against both i think” “you cannot say whether it is required against one more than against the other” “no i can hardly answer that question” ns “does there appear to be any desire on the part of the employers that the boys should have such hours as to enable them to go to school” “no the hours are never shortened for that purpose” n mr kinnaird “should you say that the colliers generally improve their education have you any instances of men who have since they began to work greatly improved their education or do they not rather go back and lose any advantage that they may have gained” “they generally become worse they do not improve they acquire bad habits they get on to drinking and gambling and such like and they go completely to wreck” n “do they make any attempt of the kind for providing instruction by having schools at night” “there are few collieries where night schools are held and perhaps at those collieries a few boys do go to those schools but they are so physically exhausted that it is to no purpose that they go there” n “you are then” concludes the bourgeois “against education” “most certainly not but” c n “but are they the employers not compelled to demand them school certificates” “by law they are but i am not aware that they are demanded by the employers” “then it is your opinion that this provision of the act as to requiring certificates is not generally carried out in the collieries” “it is not carried out” ns “do the men take a great interest in this question of education” “the majority of them do” n “are they very anxious to see the law enforced” “the majority are” n “do you think that in this country any law that you pass can really be effectual unless the population themselves assist in putting it into operation” “many a man might wish to object to employing a boy but he would perhaps become marked by it” n “marked by whom” “by his employers” n “do you think that the employers would find any fault with a man who obeyed the law ” “i believe they would” n “have you ever heard of any workman objecting to employ a boy between and who could not write or read” “it is not left to men’s option” n “would you call for the interference of parliament” “i think that if anything effectual is to be done in the education of the colliers’ children it will have to be made compulsory by act of parliament” n “would you lay that obligation upon the colliers only or all the workpeople of great britain” “i came to speak for the colliers” n “why should you distinguish them colliery boys from other boys” “because i think they are an exception to the rule” n “in what respect” “in a physical respect” n “why should education be more valuable to them than to other classes of lads” “i do not know that it is more valuable but through the overexertion in mines there is less chance for the boys that are employed there to get education either at sunday schools or at day schools” n “it is impossible to look at a question of this sort absolutely by itself” n “is there a sufficiency of schools” – “no n “if the state were to require that every child should be sent to school would there be schools for the children to go to” “no but i think if the circumstances were to spring up the schools would be forthcoming” n “some of them the boys cannot read and write at all i suppose” “the majority cannot the majority of the men themselves cannot” ns iii employment of women – since women are no more employed underground but are occupied on the surface in loading the coal c in drawing the tubs to the canals and railway waggons in sorting c their numbers have considerably increased during the last three or four years n they are mostly the wives daughters and widows of the working miners and their ages range from to or years ns “what is the feeling among the working miners as to the employment of women” “i think they generally condemn it” n “what objection do you see to it” “i think it is degrading to the sex” n “there is a peculiarity of dress” “yes it is rather a man’s dress and i believe in some cases it drowns all sense of decency” “do the women smoke” “some do” “and i suppose it is very dirty work” “very dirty” “they get black and grimy” “as black as those who are down the mines i believe that a woman having children and there are plenty on the banks that have cannot do her duty to her children” ns “do you think that those widows could get employment anywhere else which would bring them in as much wages as that from s to s a week” “i cannot speak to that” n “you would still be prepared would you” flinthearted fellow “to prevent their obtaining a livelihood by these means” “i would” n “what is the general feeling in the district as to the employment of women” “the feeling is that it is degrading and we wish as miners to have more respect to the fair sex than to see them placed on the pit bank some part of the work is very hard some of these girls have raised as much as tons of stuff a day” ns “do you think that the women employed about the collieries are less moral than the women employed in the factories” “ the percentage of bad ones may be a little more than with the girls in the factories” n “but you are not quite satisfied with the state of morality in the factories” “no” n “would you prohibit the employment of women in factories also” “no i would not” n “why not” “i think it a more honourable occupation for them in the mills” n “still it is injurious to their morality you think” “not so much as working on the pit bank but it is more on the social position i take it i do not take it on its moral ground alone the degradation in its social bearing on the girls is deplorable in the extreme when these or girls become colliers’ wives the men suffer greatly from this degradation and it causes them to leave their homes and drink” n “you would be obliged to stop the employment of women in the ironworks as well would you not if you stopped it in the collieries” “i cannot speak for any other trade” n “can you see any difference in the circumstances of women employed in ironworks and the circumstances of women employed above ground in collieries” “i have not ascertained anything as to that” n “can you see anything that makes a distinction between one class and the other” “i have not ascertained that but i know from house to house visitation that it is a deplorable state of things in our district” n “would you interfere in every case with the employment of women where that employment was degrading” “it would become injurious i think in this way the best feelings of englishmen have been gained from the instruction of a mother ” n “that equally applies to agricultural employments does it not” “yes but that is only for two seasons and we have work all the four seasons” n “they often work day and night wet through to the skin their constitution undermined and their health ruined” “you have not inquired into that subject perhaps” “i have certainly taken note of it as i have gone along and certainly i have seen nothing parallel to the effects of the employment of women on the pit bank it is the work of a man a strong man” ns “your feeling upon the whole subject is that the better class of colliers who desire to raise themselves and humanise themselves instead of deriving help from the women are pulled down by them” “yes” n after some further crooked questions from these bourgeois the secret of their “sympathy” for widows poor families c comes out at last “the coal proprietor appoints certain gentlemen to take the oversight of the workings and it is their policy in order to receive approbation to place things on the most economical basis they can and these girls are employed at from s up to s d a day where a man at the rate of s d a day would have to be employed” n iv coroner’s inquests – “with regard to coroner’s inquests in your district have the workmen confidence in the proceedings at those inquests when accidents occur” “no they have not” n “why not” “chiefly because the men who are generally chosen are men who know nothing about mines and such like” “are not workmen summoned at all upon the juries” “never but as witnesses to my knowledge” “who are the people who are generally summoned upon these juries” “generally tradesmen in the neighbourhood from their circumstances they are sometimes liable to be influenced by their employers the owners of the works they are generally men who have no knowledge and can scarcely understand the witnesses who are called before them and the terms which are used and such like” “would you have the jury composed of persons who had been employed in mining” “yes partly they the workmen think that the verdict is not in accordance with the evidence given generally” ns “one great object in summoning a jury is to have an impartial one is it not” “yes i should think so” “do you think that the juries would be impartial if they were composed to a considerable extent of workmen” “i cannot see any motive which the workmen would have to act partially they necessarily have a better knowledge of the operations in connexion with the mine” “you do not think there would be a tendency on the part of the workmen to return unfairly severe verdicts” “no i think not” ns v false weights and measures – the workmen demand to be paid weekly instead of fortnightly and by weight instead of by cubical contents of the tubs they also demand protection against the use of false weights c n “if the tubs were fraudulently increased a man could discontinue working by giving days’ notice” “but if he goes to another place there is the same thing going on there” n “but he can leave that place where the wrong has been committed” “it is general wherever he goes he has to submit to it” n “could a man leave by giving days’ notice” “yes” n and yet they are not satisfied vi inspection of mines – casualties from explosions are not the only things the workmen suffer from n sqq “our men complained very much of the bad ventilation of the collieries the ventilation is so bad in general that the men can scarcely breathe they are quite unfit for employment of any kind after they have been for a length of time in connexion with their work indeed just at the part of the mine where i am working men have been obliged to leave their employment and come home in consequence of that some of them have been out of work for weeks just in consequence of the bad state of the ventilation where there is not explosive gas there is plenty of air generally in the main courses yet pains are not taken to get air into the workings where men are working” “why do you not apply to the inspector” “to tell the truth there are many men who are timid on that point there have been cases of men being sacrificed and losing their employment in consequence of applying to the inspector” “why is he a marked man for having complained” “yes and he finds it difficult to get employment in another mine” “yes” “do you think the mines in your neighbourhood are sufficiently inspected to insure a compliance with the provisions of the act” “no they are not inspected at all the inspector has been down just once in the pit and it has been going seven years in the district to which i belong there are not a sufficient number of inspectors we have one old man more than years of age to inspect more than collieries” “you wish to have a class of subinspectors” “yes” ns “but do you think it would be possible for government to maintain such an army of inspectors as would be necessary to do all that you want them to do without information from the men” “no i should think it would be next to impossible” “it would be desirable the inspectors should come oftener” “yes and without being sent for” n “do you not think that the effect of having these inspectors examining the collieries so frequently would be to shift the responsibility of supplying proper ventilation from the owners of the collieries to the government officials” “no i do not think that i think that they should make it their business to enforce the acts which are already in existence” n “when you speak of subinspectors do you mean men at a less salary and of an inferior stamp to the present inspectors” “i would not have them inferior if you could get them otherwise” n “do you merely want more inspectors or do you want a lower class of men as an inspector” “a man who would knock about and see that things are kept right a man who would not be afraid of himself” n “if you obtained your wish in getting an inferior class of inspectors appointed do you think that there would be no danger from want of skill c” “i think not i think that the government would see after that and have proper men in that position” n this kind of examination becomes at last too much even for the chairman of the committee and he interrupts with the observation “you want a class of men who would look into all the details of the mine and would go into all the holes and corners and go into the real facts they would report to the chief inspector who would then bring his scientific knowledge to bear on the facts they have stated” ns “would it not entail very great expense if all these old workings were kept ventilated” “yes expense might be incurred but life would be at the same time protected” n a working miner objects to the th section of the act of he says “at the present time if the inspector of mines finds a part of the mine unfit to work in he has to report it to the mineowner and the home secretary after doing that there is given to the owner days to look over the matter at the end of days he has the power to refuse making any alteration in the mine but when he refuses the mineowner writes to the home secretary at the same time nominating five engineers and from those five engineers named by the mineowner himself the home secretary appoints one i think as arbitrator or appoints arbitrators from them now we think in that case the mineowner virtually appoints his own arbitrator” n bourgeois examiner himself a mineowner “but is this a merely speculative objection” n “then you have a very poor opinion of the integrity of mining engineers” “it is most certainly unjust and inequitable” n “do not mining engineers possess a sort of public character and do not you think that they are above making such a partial decision as you apprehend” “i do not wish to answer such a question as that with respect to the personal character of those men i believe that in many cases they would act very partially indeed and that it ought not to be in their hands to do so where men’s lives are at stake” n this same bourgeois is not ashamed to put this question “do you not think that the mineowner also suffers loss from an explosion” finally “are not you workmen in lancashire able to take care of your own interests without calling in the government to help you” “no” n in the year there were coal mines in great britain and inspectors a yorkshire mineowner himself calculates times th january that putting on one side their office work which absorbs all their time each mine can be visited but once in ten years by an inspector no wonder that explosions have increased progressively both in number and extent sometimes with a loss of men during the last ten years these are the beauties of “free” capitalist production this sentence has been added to the english text in conformity with the th german edition – ed the very defective act passed in is the first that regulates the hours of labour of the children employed in mines and makes exploiters and owners to a certain extent responsible for socalled accidents the royal commission appointed in to inquire into the employment in agriculture of children young persons and women has published some very important reports several attempts to apply the principles of the factory acts but in a modified form to agriculture have been made but have so far resulted in complete failure all that i wish to draw attention to here is the existence of an irresistible tendency towards the general application of those principles if the general extension of factory legislation to all trades for the purpose of protecting the workingclass both in mind and body has become inevitable on the other hand as we have already pointed out that extension hastens on the general conversion of numerous isolated small industries into a few combined industries carried on upon a large scale it therefore accelerates the concentration of capital and the exclusive predominance of the factory system it destroys both the ancient and the transitional forms behind which the dominion of capital is still in part concealed and replaces them by the direct and open sway of capital but thereby it also generalises the direct opposition to this sway while in each individual workshop it enforces uniformity regularity order and economy it increases by the immense spur which the limitation and regulation of the working day give to technical improvement the anarchy and the catastrophes of capitalist production as a whole the intensity of labour and the competition of machinery with the labourer by the destruction of petty and domestic industries it destroys the last resort of the “redundant population” and with it the sole remaining safetyvalve of the whole social mechanism by maturing the material conditions and the combination on a social scale of the processes of production it matures the contradictions and antagonisms of the capitalist form of production and thereby provides along with the elements for the formation of a new society the forces for exploding the old one section modern industry and agriculture the revolution called forth by modern industry in agriculture and in the social relations of agricultural producers will be investigated later on in this place we shall merely indicate a few results by way of anticipation if the use of machinery in agriculture is for the most part free from the injurious physical effect it has on the factory operative its action in superseding the labourers is more intense and finds less resistance as we shall see later in detail in the counties of cambridge and suffolk for example the area of cultivated land has extended very much within the last years up to while in the same period the rural population has diminished not only relatively but absolutely in the united states it is as yet only virtually that agricultural machines replace labourers in other words they allow of the cultivation by the farmer of a larger surface but do not actually expel the labourers employed in the number of persons occupied in england and wales in the manufacture of agricultural machines was whilst the number of agricultural labourers employed in the use of agricultural machines and steamengines did not exceed in the sphere of agriculture modern industry has a more revolutionary effect than elsewhere for this reason that it annihilates the peasant that bulwark of the old society and replaces him by the wagelabourer thus the desire for social changes and the class antagonisms are brought to the same level in the country as in the towns the irrational oldfashioned methods of agriculture are replaced by scientific ones capitalist production completely tears asunder the old bond of union which held together agriculture and manufacture in their infancy but at the same time it creates the material conditions for a higher synthesis in the future viz the union of agriculture and industry on the basis of the more perfected forms they have each acquired during their temporary separation capitalist production by collecting the population in great centres and causing an everincreasing preponderance of town population on the one hand concentrates the historical motive power of society on the other hand it disturbs the circulation of matter between man and the soil ie prevents the return to the soil of its elements consumed by man in the form of food and clothing it therefore violates the conditions necessary to lasting fertility of the soil by this action it destroys at the same time the health of the town labourer and the intellectual life of the rural labourer but while upsetting the naturally grown conditions for the maintenance of that circulation of matter it imperiously calls for its restoration as a system as a regulating law of social production and under a form appropriate to the full development of the human race in agriculture as in manufacture the transformation of production under the sway of capital means at the same time the martyrdom of the producer the instrument of labour becomes the means of enslaving exploiting and impoverishing the labourer the social combination and organisation of labourprocesses is turned into an organised mode of crushing out the workman’s individual vitality freedom and independence the dispersion of the rural labourers over larger areas breaks their power of resistance while concentration increases that of the town operatives in modern agriculture as in the urban industries the increased productiveness and quantity of the labour set in motion are bought at the cost of laying waste and consuming by disease labourpower itself moreover all progress in capitalistic agriculture is a progress in the art not only of robbing the labourer but of robbing the soil all progress in increasing the fertility of the soil for a given time is a progress towards ruining the lasting sources of that fertility the more a country starts its development on the foundation of modern industry like the united states for example the more rapid is this process of destruction capitalist production therefore develops technology and the combining together of various processes into a social whole only by sapping the original sources of all wealththe soil and the labourer part production of absolute and relative surplusvalue chapter absolute and relative surplusvalue in considering the labourprocess we began see chapter vii by treating it in the abstract apart from its historical forms as a process between man and nature we there stated “if we examine the whole labourprocess from the point of view of its result it is plain that both the instruments and the subject of labour are means of production and that the labour itself is productive labour” and in note same page we further added “this method of determining from the standpoint of the labourprocess alone what is productive labour is by no means directly applicable to the case of the capitalist process of production” we now proceed to the further development of this subject so far as the labourprocess is purely individual one and the same labourer unites in himself all the functions that later on become separated when an individual appropriates natural objects for his livelihood no one controls him but himself afterwards he is controlled by others a single man cannot operate upon nature without calling his own muscles into play under the control of his own brain as in the natural body head and hand wait upon each other so the labourprocess unites the labour of the hand with that of the head later on they part company and even become deadly foes the product ceases to be the direct product of the individual and becomes a social product produced in common by a collective labourer ie by a combination of workmen each of whom takes only a part greater or less in the manipulation of the subject of their labour as the cooperative character of the labourprocess becomes more and more marked so as a necessary consequence does our notion of productive labour and of its agent the productive labourer become extended in order to labour productively it is no longer necessary for you to do manual work yourself enough if you are an organ of the collective labourer and perform one of its subordinate functions the first definition given above of productive labour a definition deduced from the very nature of the production of material objects still remains correct for the collective labourer considered as a whole but it no longer holds good for each member taken individually on the other hand however our notion of productive labour becomes narrowed capitalist production is not merely the production of commodities it is essentially the production of surplusvalue the labourer produces not for himself but for capital it no longer suffices therefore that he should simply produce he must produce surplusvalue that labourer alone is productive who produces surplusvalue for the capitalist and thus works for the selfexpansion of capital if we may take an example from outside the sphere of production of material objects a schoolmaster is a productive labourer when in addition to belabouring the heads of his scholars he works like a horse to enrich the school proprietor that the latter has laid out his capital in a teaching factory instead of in a sausage factory does not alter the relation hence the notion of a productive labourer implies not merely a relation between work and useful effect between labourer and product of labour but also a specific social relation of production a relation that has sprung up historically and stamps the labourer as the direct means of creating surplusvalue to be a productive labourer is therefore not a piece of luck but a misfortune in book iv which treats of the history of the theory it will be more clearly seen that the production of surplusvalue has at all times been made by classical political economists the distinguishing characteristic of the productive labourer hence their definition of a productive labourer changes with their comprehension of the nature of surplusvalue thus the physiocrats insist that only agricultural labour is productive since that alone they say yields a surplusvalue and they say so because with them surplusvalue has no existence except in the form of rent the prolongation of the working day beyond the point at which the labourer would have produced just an equivalent for the value of his labourpower and the appropriation of that surplus labour by capital this is production of absolute surplusvalue it forms the general groundwork of the capitalist system and the startingpoint for the production of relative surplusvalue the latter presupposes that the working day is already divided into two parts necessary labour and surplus labour in order to prolong the surplus labour the necessary labour is shortened by methods whereby the equivalent for the wages is produced in less time the production of absolute surplusvalue turns exclusively upon the length of the working day the production of relative surplusvalue revolutionises out and out the technical processes of labour and the composition of society it therefore presupposes a specific mode the capitalist mode of production a mode which along with its methods means and conditions arises and develops itself spontaneously on the foundation afforded by the formal subjection of labour to capital in the course of this development the formal subjection is replaced by the real subjection of labour to capital it will suffice merely to refer to certain intermediate forms in which surplus labour is not extorted by direct compulsion from the producer nor the producer himself yet formally subjected to capital in such forms capital has not yet acquired the direct control of the labourprocess by the side of independent producers who carry on their handicrafts and agriculture in the traditional oldfashioned way there stands the usurer or the merchant with his usurer’s capital or merchant’s capital feeding on them like a parasite the predominance in a society of this form of exploitation excludes the capitalist mode of production to which mode however this form may serve as a transition as it did towards the close of the middle ages finally as is shown by modern “domestic industry” some intermediate forms are here and there reproduced in the background of modern industry though their physiognomy is totally changed if on the one hand the mere formal subjection of labour to capital suffices for the production of absolute surplusvalue if eg it is sufficient that handicraftsmen who previously worked on their own account or as apprentices of a master should become wage labourers under the direct control of a capitalist so on the other hand we have seen how the methods of producing relative surplusvalue are at the same time methods of producing absolute surplusvalue nay more the excessive prolongation of the working day turned out to be the peculiar product of modern industry generally speaking the specifically capitalist mode of production ceases to be a mere means of producing relative surplusvalue so soon as that mode has conquered an entire branch of production and still more so so soon as it has conquered all the important branches it then becomes the general socially predominant form of production as a special method of producing relative surplusvalue it remains effective only first in so far as it seizes upon industries that previously were only formally subject to capital that is so far as it is propagandist secondly in so far as the industries that have been taken over by it continue to be revolutionised by changes in the methods of production from one standpoint any distinction between absolute and relative surplusvalue appears illusory relative surplusvalue is absolute since it compels the absolute prolongation of the working day beyond the labourtime necessary to the existence of the labourer himself absolute surplusvalue is relative since it makes necessary such a development of the productiveness of labour as will allow of the necessary labourtime being confined to a portion of the working day but if we keep in mind the behaviour of surplusvalue this appearance of identity vanishes once the capitalist mode of production is established and become general the difference between absolute and relative surplusvalue makes itself felt whenever there is a question of raising the rate of surplusvalue assuming that labourpower is paid for at its value we are confronted by this alternative given the productiveness of labour and its normal intensity the rate of surplusvalue can be raised only by the actual prolongation of the working day on the other hand given the length of the working day that rise can be effected only by a change in the relative magnitudes of the components of the working day viz necessary labour and surplus labour a change which if the wages are not to fall below the value of labourpower presupposes a change either in the productiveness or in the intensity of the labour if the labourer wants all his time to produce the necessary means of subsistence for himself and his race he has no time left in which to work gratis for others without a certain degree of productiveness in his labour he has no such superfluous time at his disposal without such superfluous time no surplus labour and therefore no capitalists no slaveowners no feudal lords in one word no class of large proprietors thus we may say that surplusvalue rests on a natural basis but this is permissible only in the very general sense that there is no natural obstacle absolutely preventing one man from disburdening himself of the labour requisite for his own existence and burdening another with it any more for instance than unconquerable natural obstacle prevent one man from eating the flesh of another no mystical ideas must in any way be connected as sometimes happens with this historically developed productiveness of labour it is only after men have raised themselves above the rank of animals when therefore their labour has been to some extent socialised that a state of things arises in which the surplus labour of the one becomes a condition of existence for the other at the dawn of civilisation the productiveness acquired by labour is small but so too are the wants which develop with and by the means of satisfying them further at that early period the portion of society that lives on the labour of others is infinitely small compared with the mass of direct producers along with the progress in the productiveness of labour that small portion of society increases both absolutely and relatively besides capital with its accompanying relations springs up from an economic soil that is the product of a long process of development the productiveness of labour that serves as its foundation and startingpoint is a gift not of nature but of a history embracing thousands of centuries apart from the degree of development greater or less in the form of social production the productiveness of labour is fettered by physical conditions these are all referable to the constitution of man himself race c and to surrounding nature the external physical conditions fall into two great economic classes natural wealth in means of subsistence ie a fruitful soil waters teeming with fish c and natural wealth in the instruments of labour such as waterfalls navigable rivers wood metal coal c at the dawn of civilisation it is the first class that turns the scale at a higher stage of development it is the second compare for example england with india or in ancient times athens and corinth with the shores of the black sea the fewer the number of natural wants imperatively calling for satisfaction and the greater the natural fertility of the soil and the favourableness of the climate so much less is the labourtime necessary for the maintenance and reproduction of the producer so much greater therefore can be the excess of his labours for others over his labour for himself diodorus long ago remarked this in relation to the ancient egyptians “it is altogether incredible how little trouble and expense the bringing up of their children causes them they cook for them the first simple food at hand they also give them the lower part of the papyrus stem to eat so far as it can be roasted in the fire and the roots and stalks of marsh plants some raw some boiled and roasted most of the children go without shoes and unclothed for the air is so mild hence a child until he is grown up costs his parents not more on the whole than twenty drachmas it is this chiefly which explains why the population of egypt is so numerous and therefore why so many great works can be undertaken” nevertheless the grand structures of ancient egypt are less due to the extent of its population than to the large proportion of it that was freely disposable just as the individual labourer can do more surplus labour in proportion as his necessary labourtime is less so with regard to the working population the smaller the part of it which is required for the production of the necessary means of subsistence so much the greater is the part that can be set to do other work capitalist production once assumed then all other circumstances remaining the same and given the length of the working day the quantity of surplus labour will vary with the physical conditions of labour especially with the fertility of the soil but it by no means follows from this that the most fruitful soil is the most fitted for the growth of the capitalist mode of production this mode is based on the dominion of man over nature where nature is too lavish she “keeps him in hand like a child in leadingstrings” she does not impose upon him any necessity to develop himself it is not the tropics with their luxuriant vegetation but the temperate zone that is the mothercountry of capital it is not the mere fertility of the soil but the differentiation of the soil the variety of its natural products the changes of the seasons which form the physical basis for the social division of labour and which by changes in the natural surroundings spur man on to the multiplication of his wants his capabilities his means and modes of labour it is the necessity of bringing a natural force under the control of society of economising of appropriating or subduing it on a large scale by the work of man’s hand that first plays the decisive part in the history of industry examples are the irrigation works in egypt lombardy holland or in india and persia where irrigation by means of artificial canals not only supplies the soil with the water indispensable to it but also carries down to it in the shape of sediment from the hills mineral fertilisers the secret of the flourishing state of industry in spain and sicily under the dominion of the arabs lay in their irrigation works favourable natural conditions alone give us only the possibility never the reality of surplus labour nor consequently of surplusvalue and a surplusproduct the result of difference in the natural conditions of labour is this that the same quantity of labour satisfies in different countries a different mass of requirements consequently that under circumstances in other respects analogous the necessary labourtime is different these conditions affect surplus labour only as natural limits ie by fixing the points at which labour for others can begin in proportion as industry advances these natural limits recede in the midst of our west european society where the labourer purchases the right to work for his own livelihood only by paying for it in surplus labour the idea easily takes root that it is an inherent quality of human labour to furnish a surplusproduct but consider for example an inhabitant of the eastern islands of the asiatic archipelago where sago grows wild in the forests “when the inhabitants have convinced themselves by boring a hole in the tree that the pith is ripe the trunk is cut down and divided into several pieces the pith is extracted mixed with water and filtered it is then quite fit for use as sago one tree commonly yields lbs and occasionally to lbs there then people go into the forests and cut bread for themselves just as with us they cut firewood” suppose now such an eastern breadcutter requires working hours a week for the satisfaction of all his wants nature’s direct gift to him is plenty of leisure time before he can apply this leisure time productively for himself a whole series of historical events is required before he spends it in surplus labour for strangers compulsion is necessary if capitalist production were introduced the honest fellow would perhaps have to work six days a week in order to appropriate to himself the product of one working day the bounty of nature does not explain why he would then have to work days a week or why he must furnish days of surplus labour it explains only why his necessary labourtime would be limited to one day a week but in no case would his surplusproduct arise from some occult quality inherent in human labour thus not only does the historically developed social productiveness of labour but also its natural productiveness appear to be productiveness of the capital with which that labour is incorporated ricardo never concerns himself about the origin of surplusvalue he treats it as a thing inherent in the capitalist mode of production which mode in his eyes is the natural form of social production whenever he discusses the productiveness of labour he seeks in it not the cause of surplusvalue but the cause that determines the magnitude of that value on the other hand his school has openly proclaimed the productiveness of labour to be the originating cause of profit read surplusvalue this at all events is a progress as against the mercantilists who on their side derived the excess of the price over the cost of production of the product from the act of exchange from the product being sold above its value nevertheless ricardo’s school simply shirked the problem they did not solve it in fact these bourgeois economists instinctively saw and rightly so that it is very dangerous to stir too deeply the burning question of the origin of surplusvalue but what are we to think of john stuart mill who half a century after ricardo solemnly claims superiority over the mercantilists by clumsily repeating the wretched evasions of ricardo’s earliest vulgarisers mill says “the cause of profit is that labour produces more than is required for its support” so far nothing but the old story but mill wishing to add something of his own proceeds “to vary the form of the theorem the reason why capital yields a profit is because food clothing materials and tools last longer than the time which was required to produce them” he here confounds the duration of labourtime with the duration of its products according to this view a baker whose product lasts only a day could never extract from his workpeople the same profit as a machine maker whose products endure for years and more of course it is very true that if a bird’s nest did not last longer than the time it takes in building birds would have to do without nests this fundamental truth once established mill establishes his own superiority over the mercantilists “we thus see” he proceeds “that profit arises not from the incident of exchange but from the productive power of labour and the general profit of the country is always what the productive power of labour makes it whether any exchange takes place or not if there were no division of employments there would be no buying or selling but there would still be profit” for mill then exchange buying and selling those general conditions of capitalist production are but an incident and there would always be profits even without the purchase and sale of labourpower “if” he continues “the labourers of the country collectively produce twenty per cent more than their wages profits will be twenty per cent whatever prices may or may not be” this is on the one hand a rare bit of tautology for if labourers produce a surplusvalue of for the capitalist his profit will be to the total wages of the labourers as on the other hand it is absolutely false to say that “profits will be ” they will always be less because they are calculated upon the sum total of the capital advanced if for example the capitalist have advanced £ of which £ oo is laid out in means of production and £ in wages and if the rate of surplusvalue be the rate of profit will be ie and not then follows a splendid example of mill’s method of handling the different historical forms of social production “i assume throughout the state of things which where the labourers and capitalists are separate classes prevails with few exceptions universally namely that the capitalist advances the whole expenses including the entire remuneration of the labourer” strange optical illusion to see everywhere a state of things which as yet exists only exceptionally on our earth but let us finish – mill is willing to concede “that he should do so is not a matter of inherent necessity” on the contrary “the labourer might wait until the production is complete for all that part of his wages which exceeds mere necessaries and even for the whole if he has funds in hand sufficient for his temporary support but in the latter case the labourer is to that extent really a capitalist in the concern by supplying a portion of the funds necessary for carrying it on” mill might have gone further and have added that the labourer who advances to himself not only the necessaries of life but also the means of production is in reality nothing but his own wagelabourer he might also have said that the american peasant proprietor is but a serf who does enforced labour for himself instead of for his lord after thus proving clearly that even if capitalist production had no existence still it would always exist mill is consistent enough to show on the contrary that it has no existence even when it does exist “and even in the former case” when the workman is a wage labourer to whom the capitalist advances all the necessaries of life he the labourer “may be looked upon in the same light” ie as a capitalist “since contributing his labour at less than the marketprice he may be regarded as lending the difference to his employer and receiving it back with interest c” in reality the labourer advances his labour gratuitously to the capitalist during say one week in order to receive the market price at the end of the week c and it is this which according to mill transforms him into a capitalist on the level plain simple mounds look like hills and the imbecile flatness of the present bourgeoisie is to be measured by the altitude of its great intellects chapter changes of magnitude in the price of labourpower and in surplusvalue the value of labourpower is determined by the value of the necessaries of life habitually required by the average labourer the quantity of these necessaries is known at any given epoch of a given society and can therefore be treated as a constant magnitude what changes is the value of this quantity there are besides two other factors that enter into the determination of the value of labourpower one the expenses of developing that power which expenses vary with the mode of production the other its natural diversity the difference between the labourpower of men and women of children and adults the employment of these different sorts of labourpower an employment which is in its turn made necessary by the mode of production makes a great difference in the cost of maintaining the family of the labourer and in the value of the labourpower of the adult male both these factors however are excluded in the following investigation i assume that commodities are sold at their value that the price of labourpower rises occasionally above its value but never sinks below it on this assumption we have seen that the relative magnitudes of surplusvalue and of price of labourpower are determined by three circumstances the length of the working day or the extensive magnitude of labour the normal intensity of labour its intensive magnitude whereby a given quantity of labour is expended in a given time the productiveness of labour whereby the same quantum of labour yields in a given time a greater or less quantum of product dependent on the degree of development in the conditions of production very different combinations are clearly possible according as one of the three factors is constant and two variable or two constant and one variable or lastly all three simultaneously variable and the number of these combinations is augmented by the fact that when these factors simultaneously vary the amount and direction of their respective variations may differ in what follows the chief combinations alone are considered section length of the working day and intensity of labour constant productiveness of labour variable on these assumptions the value of labourpower and the magnitude of surplusvalue are determined by three laws a working day of given length always creates the same amount of value no matter how the productiveness of labour and with it the mass of the product and the price of each single commodity produced may vary if the value created by a working day of hours be say six shillings then although the mass of the articles produced varies with the productiveness of labour the only result is that the value represented by six shillings is spread over a greater or less number of articles surplusvalue and the value of labourpower vary in opposite directions a variation in the productiveness of labour its increase or diminution causes a variation in the opposite direction in the value of labourpower and in the same direction in surplusvalue the value created by a working day of hours is a constant quantity say six shillings this constant quantity is the sum of the surplusvalue plus the value of the labourpower which latter value the labourer replaces by an equivalent it is selfevident that if a constant quantity consists of two parts neither of them can increase without the other diminishing let the two parts at starting be equal shillings value of labourpower shillings surplusvalue then the value of the labourpower cannot rise from three shillings to four without the surplusvalue falling from three shillings to two and the surplusvalue cannot rise from three shillings to four without the value of labourpower falling from three shillings to two under these circumstances therefore no change can take place in the absolute magnitude either of the surplusvalue or of the value of labourpower without a simultaneous change in their relative magnitudes ie relatively to each other it is impossible for them to rise or fall simultaneously further the value of labourpower cannot fall and consequently surplusvalue cannot rise without a rise in the productiveness of labour for instance in the above case the value of the labourpower cannot sink from three shillings to two unless an increase in the productiveness of labour makes it possible to produce in hours the same quantity of necessaries as previously required hours to produce on the other hand the value of the labourpower cannot rise from three shillings to four without a decrease in the productiveness of labour whereby eight hours become requisite to produce the same quantity of necessaries for the production of which six hours previously sufficed it follows from this that an increase in the productiveness of labour causes a fall in the value of labourpower and a consequent rise in surplusvalue while on the other hand a decrease in such productiveness causes a rise in the value of labourpower and a fall in surplusvalue in formulating this law ricardo overlooked one circumstance although a change in the magnitude of the surplusvalue or surplus labour causes a change in the opposite direction in the magnitude of the value of labourpower or in the quantity of necessary labour it by no means follows that they vary in the same proportion they do increase or diminish by the same quantity but their proportional increase or diminution depends on their original magnitudes before the change in the productiveness of labour took place if the value of the labourpower be shillings or the necessary labour time hours and the surplusvalue be shillings or the surplus labour hours and if in consequence of an increase in the productiveness of labour the value of the labourpower fall to shillings or the necessary labour to hours the surplusvalue will rise to shillings or the surplus labour to hours the same quantity shilling or hours is added in one case and subtracted in the other but the proportional change of magnitude is different in each case while the value of the labourpower falls from shillings to ie by or the surplusvalue rises from shillings to ie by or it therefore follows that the proportional increase or diminution in surplusvalue consequent on a given change in the productiveness of labour depends on the original magnitude of that portion of the working day which embodies itself in surplusvalue the smaller that portion the greater is the proportional change the greater that portion the less is the proportional change increase or diminution in surplusvalue is always consequent on and never the cause of the corresponding diminution or increase in the value of labourpower since the working day is constant in magnitude and is represented by a value of constant magnitude since to every variation in the magnitude of surplusvalue there corresponds an inverse variation in the value of labourpower and since the value of labourpower cannot change except in consequence of a change in the productiveness of labour it clearly follows under these conditions that every change of magnitude in surplusvalue arises from an inverse change of magnitude in the value of labourpower if then as we have already seen there can be no change of absolute magnitude in the value of labourpower and in surplusvalue unaccompanied by a change in their relative magnitudes so now it follows that no change in their relative magnitudes is possible without a previous change in the absolute magnitude of the value of labourpower according to the third law a change in the magnitude of surplusvalue presupposes a movement in the value of labourpower which movement is brought about by a variation in the productiveness of labour the limit of this change is given by the altered value of labourpower nevertheless even when circumstances allow the law to operate subsidiary movements may occur for example if in consequence of the increased productiveness of labour the value of labourpower falls from shillings to or the necessary labour time from hours to the price of labourpower may possibly not fall below s d s d or s d and the surplusvalue consequently not rise above s d s d or s d the amount of this fall the lowest limit of which is shillings the new value of labourpower depends on the relative weight which the pressure of capital on the one side and the resistance of the labourer on the other throws into the scale the value of labourpower is determined by the value of a given quantity of necessaries it is the value and not the mass of these necessaries that varies with the productiveness of labour it is however possible that owing to an increase of productiveness both the labourer and the capitalist may simultaneously be able to appropriate a greater quantity of these necessaries without any change in the price of labourpower or in surplusvalue if the value of labourpower be shillings and the necessary labour time amount to hours if the surplusvalue likewise be shillings and the surplus labour hours then if the productiveness of labour were doubled without altering the ratio of necessary labour to surplus labour there would be no change of magnitude in surplusvalue and price of labourpower the only result would be that each of them would represent twice as many usevalues as before these usevalues being twice as cheap as before although labourpower would be unchanged in price it would be above its value if however the price of labourpower had fallen not to s d the lowest possible point consistent with its new value but to s d or s d still this lower price would represent an increased mass of necessaries in this way it is possible with an increasing productiveness of labour for the price of labourpower to keep on falling and yet this fall to be accompanied by a constant growth in the mass of the labourers means of subsistence but even in such case the fall in the value of labourpower would cause a corresponding rise of surplusvalue and thus the abyss between the labourers position and that of the capitalist would keep widening ricardo was the first who accurately formulated the three laws we have above stated but he falls into the following errors he looks upon the special conditions under which these laws hold good as the general and sole conditions of capitalist production he knows no change either in the length of the working day or in the intensity of labour consequently with him there can be only one variable factor viz the productiveness of labour and this error vitiates his analysis much more than he has not any more than have the other economists investigated surplusvalue as such ie independently of its particular forms such as profit rent c he therefore confounds together the laws of the rate of surplusvalue and the laws of the rate of profit the rate of profit is as we have already said the ratio of the surplusvalue to the total capital advanced the rate of surplusvalue is the ratio of the surplusvalue to the variable part of that capital assume that a capital c of £ is made up of raw material instruments of labour c c to the amount of £ and of wages v to the amount of £ and further that the surplusvalue s £ then we have rate of surplusvalue sv £ £ but the rate of profit sc £ £ it is besides obvious that the rate of profit may depend on circumstances that in no way affect the rate of surplusvalue i shall show in book iii that with a given rate of surplusvalue we may have any number of rates of profit and that various rates of surplusvalue may under given conditions express themselves in a single rate of profit section working day constant productiveness of labour constant intensity of labour variable increased intensity of labour means increased expenditure of labour in a given time hence a working day of more intense labour is embodied in more products than is one of less intense labour the length of each day being the same increased productiveness of labour also it is true will supply more products in a given working day but in this latter case the value of each single product falls for it costs less labour than before in the former case that value remains unchanged for each article costs the same labour as before here we have an increase in the number of products unaccompanied by a fall in their individual prices as their number increases so does the sum of their prices but in the case of increased productiveness a given value is spread over a greater mass of products hence the length of the working day being constant a days labour of increased intensity will be incorporated in an increased value and the value of money remaining unchanged in more money the value created varies with the extent to which the intensity of labour deviates from its normal intensity in the society a given working day therefore no longer creates a constant but a variable value in a day of hours of ordinary intensity the value created is say shillings but with increased intensity the value created may be or more shillings it is clear that if the value created by a days labour increases from say to shillings then the two parts into which this value is divided viz price of labourpower and surplusvalue may both of them increase simultaneously and either equally or unequally they may both simultaneously increase from shillings to here the rise in the price of labourpower does not necessarily imply that the price has risen above the value of labourpower on the contrary the rise in price may be accompanied by a fall in value this occurs whenever the rise in the price of labourpower does not compensate for its increased wear and tear we know that with transitory exceptions a change in the productiveness of labour does not cause any change in the value of labourpower nor consequently in the magnitude of surplusvalue unless the products of the industries affected are articles habitually consumed by the labourers in the present case this condition no longer applies for when the variation is either in the duration or in the intensity of labour there is always a corresponding change in the magnitude of the value created independently of the nature of the article in which that value is embodied if the intensity of labour were to increase simultaneously and equally in every branch of industry then the new and higher degree of intensity would become the normal degree for the society and would therefore cease to be taken account of but still even then the intensity of labour would be different in different countries and would modify the international application of the law of value the more intense working day of one nation would be represented by a greater sum of money than would the less intense day of another nation section productiveness and intensity of labour constant length of the working day variable the working day may vary in two ways it may be made either longer or shorter from our present data and within the limits of the assumptions made above we obtain the following laws the working day creates a greater or less amount of value in proportion to its length – thus a variable and not a constant quantity of value every change in the relation between the magnitudes of surplusvalue and of the value of labourpower arises from a change in the absolute magnitude of the surplus labour and consequently of the surplusvalue the absolute value of labourpower can change only in consequence of the reaction exercised by the prolongation of surplus labour upon the wear and tear of labourpower every change in this absolute value is therefore the effect but never the cause of a change in the magnitude of surplusvalue we begin with the case in which the working day is shortened a shortening of the working day under the conditions given above leaves the value of labourpower and with it the necessary labour time unaltered it reduces the surplus labour and surplusvalue along with the absolute magnitude of the latter its relative magnitude also falls ie its magnitude relatively to the value of labourpower whose magnitude remains unaltered only by lowering the price of labourpower below its value could the capitalist save himself harmless all the usual arguments against the shortening of the working day assume that it takes place under the conditions we have here supposed to exist but in reality the very contrary is the case a change in the productiveness and intensity of labour either precedes or immediately follows a shortening of the working day lengthening of the working day let the necessary labour time be hours or the value of labourpower shillings also let the surplus labour be hours or the surplusvalue shillings the whole working day then amounts to hours and is embodied in a value of shillings if now the working day be lengthened by hours and the price of labourpower remain unaltered the surplusvalue increases both absolutely and relatively although there is no absolute change in the value of labourpower it suffers a relative fall under the conditions assumed in there could not be a change of relative magnitude in the value of labourpower without a change in its absolute magnitude here on the contrary the change of relative magnitude in the value of labourpower is the result of the change of absolute magnitude in surplusvalue since the value in which a days labour is embodied increases with the length of that day it is evident that the surplusvalue and the price of labourpower may simultaneously increase either by equal or unequal quantities this simultaneous increase is therefore possible in two cases one the actual lengthening of the working day the other an increase in the intensity of labour unaccompanied by such lengthening when the working day is prolonged the price of labourpower may fall below its value although that price be nominally unchanged or even rise the value of a days labourpower is as will be remembered estimated from its normal average duration or from the normal duration of life among the labourers and from corresponding normal transformations of organised bodily matter into motion in conformity with the nature of man up to a certain point the increased wear and tear of labourpower inseparable from a lengthened working day may be compensated by higher wages but beyond this point the wear and tear increases in geometrical progression and every condition suitable for the normal reproduction and functioning of labourpower is suppressed the price of labourpower and the degree of its exploitation cease to be commensurable quantities section simultaneous variations in the duration productiveness and intensity of labour it is obvious that a large number of combinations are here possible any two of the factors may vary and the third remain constant or all three may vary at once they may vary either in the same or in different degrees in the same or in opposite directions with the result that the variations counteract one another either wholly or in part nevertheless the analysis of every possible case is easy in view of the results given in i ii and iii the effect of every possible combination may be found by treating each factor in turn as variable and the other two constant for the time being we shall therefore notice and that briefly but two important cases a diminishing productiveness of labour with a simultaneous lengthening of the working day in speaking of diminishing productiveness of labour we here refer to diminution in those industries whose products determine the value of labourpower such a diminution for example as results from decreasing fertility of the soil and from the corresponding dearness of its products take the working day at hours and the value created by it at shillings of which one half replaces the value of the labourpower the other forms the surplusvalue suppose in consequence of the increased dearness of the products of the soil that the value of labourpower rises from shillings to and therefore the necessary labour time from hours to if there be no change in the length of the working day the surplus labour would fall from hours to the surplusvalue from shillings to if the day be lengthened by hours ie from hours to the surplus labour remains at hours the surplusvalue at shillings but the surplusvalue decreases compared with the value of labourpower as measured by the necessary labour time if the day be lengthened by hours viz from hours to the proportional magnitudes of surplusvalue and value of labourpower of surplus labour and necessary labour continue unchanged but the absolute magnitude of surplusvalue rises from shillings to that of the surplus labour from hours to an increment of therefore with diminishing productiveness of labour and a simultaneous lengthening of the working day the absolute magnitude of surplusvalue may continue unaltered at the same time that its relative magnitude diminishes its relative magnitude may continue unchanged at the same time that its absolute magnitude increases and provided the lengthening of the day be sufficient both may increase in the period between and the increasing price of provisions led in england to a nominal rise in wages although the real wages expressed in the necessaries of life fell from this fact west and ricardo drew the conclusion that the diminution in the productiveness of agricultural labour had brought about a fall in the rate of surplusvalue and they made this assumption of a fact that existed only in their imaginations the startingpoint of important investigations into the relative magnitudes of wages profits and rent but as a matter of fact surplusvalue had at that time thanks to the increased intensity of labour and to the prolongation of the working day increased both in absolute and relative magnitude this was the period in which the right to prolong the hours of labour to an outrageous extent was established the period that was especially characterised by an accelerated accumulation of capital here by pauperism there b increasing intensity and productiveness of labour with simultaneous shortening of the working day increased productiveness and greater intensity of labour both have a like effect they both augment the mass of articles produced in a given time both therefore shorten that portion of the working day which the labourer needs to produce his means of subsistence or their equivalent the minimum length of the working day is fixed by this necessary but contractile portion of it if the whole working day were to shrink to the length of this portion surplus labour would vanish a consummation utterly impossible under the régime of capital only by suppressing the capitalist form of production could the length of the working day be reduced to the necessary labour time but even in that case the latter would extend its limits on the one hand because the notion of “means of subsistence” would considerably expand and the labourer would lay claim to an altogether different standard of life on the other hand because a part of what is now surplus labour would then count as necessary labour i mean the labour of forming a fund for reserve and accumulation the more the productiveness of labour increases the more can the working day be shortened and the more the working day is shortened the more can the intensity of labour increase from a social point of view the productiveness increases in the same ratio as the economy of labour which in its turn includes not only economy of the means of production but also the avoidance of all useless labour the capitalist mode of production while on the one hand enforcing economy in each individual business on the other hand begets by its anarchical system of competition the most outrageous squandering of labourpower and of the social means of production not to mention the creation of a vast number of employments at present indispensable but in themselves superfluous the intensity and productiveness of labour being given the time which society is bound to devote to material production is shorter and as a consequence the time at its disposal for the free development intellectual and social of the individual is greater in proportion as the work is more and more evenly divided among all the ablebodied members of society and as a particular class is more and more deprived of the power to shift the natural burden of labour from its own shoulders to those of another layer of society in this direction the shortening of the working day finds at last a limit in the generalisation of labour in capitalist society spare time is acquired for one class by converting the whole lifetime of the masses into labour time chapter various formula for the rate of surplusvalue we have seen that the rate of surplusvalue is represented by the following formulae i surplusvalue s surplusvalue surpluslabour variable capital v value of labourpower necessary labour the two first of these formulae represent as a ratio of values that which in the third is represented as a ratio of the times during which those values are produced these formulae supplementary the one to the other are rigorously definite and correct we therefore find them substantially but not consciously worked out in classical political economy there we meet with the following derivative formulae ii surpluslabour surplusvalue surplusproduct working day value of the product total product one and the same ratio is here expressed as a ratio of labourtimes of the values in which those labourtimes are embodied and of the products in which those values exist it is of course understood that by “value of the product” is meant only the value newly created in a working day the constant part of the value of the product being excluded in all of these formulae ii the actual degree of exploitation of labour or the rate of surplusvalue is falsely expressed let the working day be hours then making the same assumptions as in former instances the real degree of exploitation of labour will be represented in the following proportions hours surpluslabour surplusvalue of sh hours necessary labour variable capital of sh from formulae ii we get very differently hours surpluslabour surplusvalue of sh working day of hours value created of sh these derivative formulae express in reality only the proportion in which the working day or the value produced by it is divided between capitalist and labourer if they are to be treated as direct expressions of the degree of selfexpansion of capital the following erroneous law would hold good surpluslabour or surplusvalue can never reach since the surpluslabour is only an aliquot part of the working day or since surplusvalue is only an aliquot part of the value created the surpluslabour must necessarily be always less than the working day or the surplusvalue always less than the total value created in order however to attain the ratio of they must be equal in order that the surpluslabour may absorb the whole day ie an average day of any week or year the necessary labour must sink to zero but if the necessary labour vanish so too does the surpluslabour since it is only a function of the former the ratio surpluslabour or surplusvalue working day value created can therefore never reach the limit still less rise to x but not so the rate of surplusvalue the real degree of exploitation of labour take eg the estimate of l de lavergne according to which the english agricultural labourer gets only the capitalist farmer on the other hand of the product or its value apart from the question of how the booty is subsequently divided between the capitalist the landlord and others according to this this surpluslabour of the english agricultural labourer is to his necessary labour as which gives a rate of exploitation of the favorite method of treating the working day as constant in magnitude became through the use of formulae ii a fixed usage because in them surpluslabour is always compared with a working day of given length the same holds good when the repartition of the value produced is exclusively kept in sight the working day that has already been realized in given value must necessarily be a day of given length the habit of representing surplusvalue and value of labourpower as fractions of the value created – a habit that originates in the capitalist mode of production itself and whose import will hereafter be disclosed – conceals the very transaction that characterizes capital namely the exchange of variable capital for living labourpower and the consequent exclusion of the labourer from the product instead of the real fact we have false semblance of an association in which labourer and capitalist divide the product in proportion to the different elements which they respectively contribute towards its formation moreover the formulae ii can at any time be reconverted into formulae i if for instance we have surpluslabour of hours working day of hours then the necessary labourtime being hours less the surpluslabour of hours we get the following result surpluslabour of hours necessary labour of hours there is a third formula which i have occasionally already anticipated it is iii surplusvalue surpluslabour unpaid labour value of labourpower necessary labour paid labour after the investigations we have given above it is no longer possible to be misled by the formula unpaid labour paid labour into concluding that the capitalist pays for labour and not for labourpower this formula is only a popular expression for surpluslabour necessary labour the capitalist pays the value so far as price coincides with value of the labourpower and receives in exchange the disposal of the living labourpower itself his usufruct is spread over two periods during one the labourer produces a value that is only equal to the value of his labourpower he produces its equivalent this the capitalist receives in return for his advance of the price of the labourpower a product ready made in the market during the other period the period of surpluslabour the usufruct of the labourpower creates a value for the capitalist that costs him no equivalent this expenditure of labourpower comes to him gratis in this sense it is that surpluslabour can be called unpaid labour capital therefore it not only as adam smith says the command over labour it is essentially the command over unpaid labour all surplusvalue whatever particular form profit interest or rent it may subsequently crystallize into is in substance the materialisation of unpaid labour the secret of the selfexpansion of capital resolves itself into having the disposal of a definite quantity of other people’s unpaid labour part wages chapter the transformation of the value and respective price of labourpower into wages on the surface of bourgeois society the wage of the labourer appears as the price of labour a certain quantity of money that is paid for a certain quantity of labour thus people speak of the value of labour and call its expression in money its necessary or natural price on the other hand they speak of the marketprices of labour ie prices oscillating above or below its natural price but what is the value of a commodity the objective form of the social labour expended in its production and how do we measure the quantity of this value by the quantity of the labour contained in it how then is the value eg of a hour workingday to be determined by the workinghours contained in a working day of hours which is an absurd tautology in order to be sold as a commodity in the market labour must at all events exist before it is sold but could the labourer give it an independent objective existence he would sell a commodity and not labour apart from these contradictions a direct exchange of money ie of realized labour with living labour would either do away with the law of value which only begins to develop itself freely on the basis of capitalist production or do away with capitalist production itself which rests directly on wagelabour the working day of hours embodies itself eg in a moneyvalue of s either equivalents are exchanged and then the labourer receives s for hours’ labour the price of his labour would be equal to the price of his product in this case he produces no surplusvalue for the buyer of his labour the s are not transformed into capital the basis of capitalist production vanishes but it is on this very basis that he sells his labour and that his labour is wagelabour or else he receives for hours’ labour less than s ie less than hours’ labour twelve hours’ labour are exchanged against c hours’ labour this equalisation of unequal quantities not merely does away with the determination of value such a selfdestructive contradiction cannot be in any way even enunciated or formulated as a law it is of no avail to deduce the exchange of more labour against less from their difference of form the one being realized the other living this is the more absurd as the value of a commodity is determined not by the quantity of labour actually realized in it but by the quantity of living labour necessary for its production a commodity represents say workinghours if an invention is made by which it can be produced in hours the value even of the commodity already produced falls by half it represents now hours of social labour instead of the formerly necessary it is the quantity of labour required for its production not the realized form of that labour by which the amount of the value of a commodity is determined that which comes directly face to face with the possessor of money on the market is in fact not labour but the labourer what the latter sells is his labourpower as soon as his labour actually begins it has already ceased to belong to him it can therefore no longer be sold by him labour is the substance and the immanent measure of value but has itself no value in the expression “value of labour” the idea of value is not only completely obliterated but actually reversed it is an expression as imaginary as the value of the earth these imaginary expressions arise however from the relations of production themselves they are categories for the phenomenal forms of essential relations that in their appearance things often represent themselves in inverted form is pretty well known in every science except political economy classical political economy borrowed from everyday life the category “price of labour” without further criticism and then simply asked the question how is this price determined it soon recognized that the change in the relations of demand and supply explained in regard to the price of labour as of all other commodities nothing except its changes ie the oscillations of the marketprice above or below a certain mean if demand and supply balance the oscillation of prices ceases all other conditions remaining the same but then demand and supply also cease to explain anything the price of labour at the moment when demand and supply are in equilibrium is its natural price determined independently of the relation of demand and supply and how this price is determined is just the question or a larger period of oscillations in the marketprice is taken eg a year and they are found to cancel one the other leaving a mean average quantity a relatively constant magnitude this had naturally to be determined otherwise than by its own compensating variations this price which always finally predominates over the accidental marketprices of labour and regulates them this “necessary price” physiocrats or “natural price” of labour adam smith can as with all other commodities be nothing else than its value expressed in money in this way political economy expected to penetrate athwart the accidental prices of labour to the value of labour as with other commodities this value was determined by the cost of production but what is the cost of production of the labourer ie the cost of producing or reproducing the labourer himself this question unconsciously substituted itself in political economy for the original one for the search after the cost of production of labour as such turned in a circle and never left the spot what economists therefore call value of labour is in fact the value of labourpower as it exists in the personality of the labourer which is as different from its function labour as a machine is from the work it performs occupied with the difference between the marketprice of labour and its socalled value with the relation of this value to the rate of profit and to the values of the commodities produced by means of labour c they never discovered that the course of the analysis had led not only from the marketprices of labour to its presumed value but had led to the resolution of this value of labour itself into the value of labourpower classical economy never arrived at a consciousness of the results of its own analysis it accepted uncritically the categories “value of labour” “natural price of labour” c as final and as adequate expressions for the valuerelation under consideration and was thus led as will be seen later into inextricable confusion and contradiction while it offered to the vulgar economists a secure basis of operations for their shallowness which on principle worships appearances only let us next see how value and price of labourpower present themselves in this transformed condition as wages we know that the daily value of labourpower is calculated upon a certain length of the labourer’s life to which again corresponds a certain length of working day assume the habitual working day as hours the daily value of labourpower as s the expression in money of a value that embodies hours of labour if the labourer receives s then he receives the value of his labourpower functioning through hours if now this value of a day’s labourpower is expressed as the value of a day’s labour itself we have the formula twelve hours’ labour has a value of s the value of labourpower thus determines the value of labour or expressed in money its necessary price if on the other hand the price of labourpower differs from its value in like manner the price of labour differs from its socalled value as the value of labour is only an irrational expression for the value of labourpower it follows of course that the value of labour must always be less than the value it produces for the capitalist always makes labourpower work longer than is necessary for the reproduction of its own value in the above example the value of the labourpower that functions through hours is s a value for the reproduction of which hours are required the value which the labourpower produces is on the other hand s because it in fact functions during hours and the value it produces depends not on its own value but on the length of time it is in action thus we have a result absurd at first sight that labour which creates a value of s possesses a value of s we see further the value of s by which a part only of the working day – ie hours’ labouris paid for appears as the value or price of the whole working day of hours which thus includes hours unpaid for the wage form thus extinguishes every trace of the division of the working day into necessary labour and surplus labour into paid and unpaid labour all labour appears as paid labour in the corvée the labour of the worker for himself and his compulsory labour for his lord differ in space and time in the clearest possible way in slave labour even that part of the working day in which the slave is only replacing the value of his own means of existence in which therefore in fact he works for himself alone appears as labour for his master all the slave’s labour appears as unpaid labour in wage labour on the contrary even surplus labour or unpaid labour appears as paid there the propertyrelation conceals the labour of the slave for himself here the moneyrelation conceals the unrequited labour of the wage labourer hence we may understand the decisive importance of the transformation of value and price of labourpower into the form of wages or into the value and price of labour itself this phenomenal form which makes the actual relation invisible and indeed shows the direct opposite of that relation forms the basis of all the juridical notions of both labourer and capitalist of all the mystifications of the capitalistic mode of production of all its illusions as to liberty of all the apologetic shifts of the vulgar economists if history took a long time to get at the bottom of the mystery of wages nothing on the other hand is more easy to understand than the necessity the raison d’etre of this phenomenon the exchange between capital and labour at first presents itself to the mind in the same guise as the buying and selling of all other commodities the buyer gives a certain sum of money the seller an article of a nature different from money the jurist’s consciousness recognizes in this at most a material difference expressed in the juridically equivalent formula “do ut des do ut facias facio ut des facio ut facias” furthermore exchangevalue and usevalue being intrinsically incommensurable magnitudes the expressions “value of labour” “price of labour” do not seem more irrational than the expressions “value of cotton” “price of cotton” moreover the labourer is paid after he has given his labour in its function of means of payment money realizes subsequently the value or price of the article supplied – ie in this particular case the value or price of the labour supplied finally the usevalue supplied by the labourer to the capitalist is not in fact his labourpower but its function some definite useful labour the work of tailoring shoemaking spinning c that this same labour is on the other hand the universal valuecreating element and thus possesses a property by which it differs from all other commodities is beyond the cognizance of the ordinary mind let us put ourselves in the place of the labourer who receives for hours’ labour say the value produced by hours’ labour say s for him in fact his hours’ labour is the means of buying the s the value of his labourpower may vary with the value of his usual means of subsistence from to shillings or from to shillings or if the value of his labourpower remains constant its price may in consequence of changing relations of demand and supply rise to s or fall to s he always gives hours of labour every change in the amount of the equivalent that he receives appears to him therefore necessarily as a change in the value or price of his hours’ work this circumstance misled adam smith who treated the working day as a constant quantity to the assertion that the value of labour is constant although the value of the means of subsistence may vary and the same working day therefore may represent itself in more or less money for the labourer let us consider on the other hand the capitalist he wishes to receive as much labour as possible for as little money as possible practically therefore the only thing that interests him is the difference between the price of labourpower and the value which its function creates but then he tries to buy all commodities as cheaply as possible and always accounts for his profit by simple cheating by buying under and selling over the value hence he never comes to see that if such a thing as the value of labour really existed and he really paid this value no capital would exist his money would not be turned into capital moreover the actual movement of wages presents phenomena which seem to prove that not the value of labourpower is paid but the value of its function of labour itself we may reduce these phenomena to two great classes change of wages with the changing length of the working day one might as well conclude that not the value of a machine is paid but that of its working because it costs more to hire a machine for a week than for a day the individual difference in the wages of different labourers who do the same kind of work we find this individual difference but are not deceived by it in the system of slavery where frankly and openly without any circumlocution labourpower itself is sold only in the slave system the advantage of a labourpower above the average and the disadvantage of a labourpower below the average affects the slaveowner in the wagelabour system it affects the labourer himself because his labourpower is in the one case sold by himself in the other by a third person for the rest in respect to the phenomenal form “value and price of labour” or “wages” as contrasted with the essential relation manifested therein viz the value and price of labourpower the same difference holds that holds in respect to all phenomena and their hidden substratum the former appear directly and spontaneously as current modes of thought the latter must first be discovered by science classical political economy nearly touches the true relation of things without however consciously formulating it this it cannot so long as it sticks in its bourgeois skin chapter timewages wages themselves again take many forms a fact not recognizable in the ordinary economic treatises which exclusively interested in the material side of the question neglect every difference of form an exposition of all these forms however belongs to the special study of wage labour not therefore to this work still the two fundamental forms must be briefly worked out here the sale of labourpower as will be remembered takes place for a definite period of time the converted form under which the daily weekly c value of labourpower presents itself is hence that of timewages therefore daywages c next it is to be noted that the laws set forth in the th chapter on the changes in the relative magnitudes of price of labourpower and surplusvalue pass by a simple transformation of form into laws of wages similarly the distinction between the exchangevalue of labour power and the sum of the necessaries of life into which this value is converted now reappears as the distinction between nominal and real wages it would be useless to repeat here with regard to the phenomenal form what has been already worked out in the substantial form we limit ourselves therefore to a few points characteristic of timewages the sum of money which the labourer receives for his daily or weekly labour forms the amount of his nominal wages or of his wages estimated in value but it is clear that according to the length of the working day that is according to the amount of actual labour daily supplied the same daily or weekly wage may represent very different prices of labour ie very different sums of money for the same quantity of labour we must therefore in considering timewages again distinguish between the sumtotal of the daily or weekly wages c and the price of labour how then to find this price ie the moneyvalue of a given quantity of labour the average price of labour is found when the average daily value of the labourpower is divided by the average number of hours in the working day if eg the daily value of labourpower is shillings the value of the product of workinghours and if the working day is hours the price of working hour is shillings d the price of the workinghour thus found serves as the unit measure for the price of labour it follows therefore that the daily and weekly wages c may remain the same although the price of labour falls constantly if eg the habitual working day is hours and the daily value of the labourpower s the price of the workinghour is d it falls to s as soon as the working day rises to hours to d as soon as it rises to hours daily or weekly wages remain despite all this unchanged on the contrary the daily or weekly wages may rise although the price of labour remains constant or even falls if eg the working day is hours and the daily value of labourpower shillings the price of one workinghour is d if the labourer in consequence of increase of trade works hours the price of labour remaining the same his daily wage now rises to shillings d without any variation in the price of labour the same result might follow if instead of the extensive amount of labour its intensive amount increased the rise of the nominal daily or weekly wages may therefore be accompanied by a price of labour that remains stationary or falls the same holds as to the income of the labourer’s family as soon as the quantity of labour expended by the head of the family is increased by the labour of the members of his family there are therefore methods of lowering the price of labour independent of the reduction of the nominal daily or weekly wages as a general law it follows that given the amount of daily or weekly labour c the daily or weekly wages depend on the price of labour which itself varies either with the value of labourpower or with the difference between its price and its value given on the other hand the price of labour the daily or weekly wages depend on the quantity of the daily or weekly labour the unitmeasure for timewages the price of the workinghour is the quotient of the value of a day’s labourpower divided by the number of hours of the average working day let the latter be hours and the daily value of labourpower shillings the value of the product of hours of labour under these circumstances the price of a working hour is d the value produced in it is d if the labourer is now employed less than hours or less than days in the week eg only or hours he receives with this price of labour only s or s d a day as on our hypothesis he must work on the average hours daily in order to produce a day’s wage corresponding merely to the value of his labour power as according to the same hypothesis he works only half of every hour for himself and half for the capitalist it is clear that he cannot obtain for himself the value of the product of hours if he is employed less than hours in previous chapters we saw the destructive consequences of overwork here we find the sources of the sufferings that result to the labourer from his insufficient employment if the hour’s wage is fixed so that the capitalist does not bind himself to pay a day’s or a week’s wage but only to pay wages for the hours during which he chooses to employ the labourer he can employ him for a shorter time than that which is originally the basis of the calculation of the hourwage or the unitmeasure of the price of labour since this unit is determined by the ratio daily value of labourpower working day of a given number of hours’ it of course loses all meaning as soon as the working day ceases to contain a definite number of hours the connection between the paid and the unpaid labour is destroyed the capitalist can now wring from the labour a certain quantity of surplus labour without allowing him the labourtime necessary for his own subsistence he can annihilate all regularity of employment and according to his own convenience caprice and the interest of the moment make the most enormous overwork alternate with relative or absolute cessation of work he can under the pretense of paying “the normal price of labour” abnormally lengthen the working day without any corresponding compensation to the labourer hence the perfectly rational revolt in of the london labourers employed in the building trades against the attempt of the capitalists to impose on them this sort of wage by the hour the legal limitation of the working day puts an end to such mischief although not of course to the diminution of employment caused by the competition of machinery by changes in the quality of the labourers employed and by crises partial or general with an increasing daily or weekly wage the price of labour may remain nominally constant and yet may fall below its normal level this occurs every time that the price of labour reckoned per workinghour remaining constant the working day is prolonged beyond its customary length if in the fraction daily value of labour power working day the denominator increases the numerator increases yet more rapidly the value of labourpower as dependent on its wear and tear increases with the duration of its functioning and in more rapid proportion than the increase of that duration in many branches of industry where timewage is the general rule without legal limits to the workingtime the habit has therefore spontaneously grown up of regarding the working day as normal only up to a certain point eg up to the expiration of the tenth hour “normal working day” “the day’s work” “the regular hours of work” beyond this limit the workingtime is overtime and is taking the hour as unitmeasure paid better “extra pay” although often in a proportion ridiculously small the normal working day exists here as a fraction of the actual working day and the latter often during the whole year lasts longer than the former the increase in the price of labour with the extension of the working day beyond a certain normal limit takes such a shape in various british industries that the low price of labour during the socalled normal time compels the labourer to work during the better paid overtime if he wishes to obtain a sufficient wage at all legal limitation of the working day puts an end to these amenities it is a fact generally known that the longer the working days in any branch of industry the lower are the wages a redgrave factory inspector illustrates this by a comparative review of the years from according to which wages rose in the factories under the hours law whilst they fell in the factories in which the work lasted to hours daily from the law “the price of labour being given the daily or weekly wage depends on the quantity of labour expended” it follows first of all that the lower the price of labour the greater must be the quantity of labour or the longer must be the working day for the labourer to secure even a miserable average wage the lowness of the price of labour acts here as a stimulus to the extension of the labourtime on the other hand the extension of the workingtime produces in its turn a fall in the price of labour and with this a fall in the day’s or week’s wages the determination of the price of labour by daily value of labour power working day of a given number of hours shows that a mere prolongation of the working day lowers the price of labour if no compensation steps in but the same circumstances which allow the capitalist in the long run to prolong the working day also allow him first and compel him finally to nominally lower the price of labour until the total price of the increased number of hours is lowered and therefore the daily or weekly wage reference to two circumstances is sufficient here if one man does the work of ½ or men the supply of labour increases although the supply of labourpower on the market remains constant the competition thus created between the labourers allows the capitalist to beat down the price of labour whilst the falling price of labour allows him on the other hand to screw up still further the workingtime soon however this command over abnormal quantities of unpaid labour ie quantities in excess of the average social amount becomes a source of competition amongst the capitalists themselves a part of the price of the commodity consists of the price of labour the unpaid part of the labourprice need not be reckoned in the price of the commodity it may be presented to the buyer this is the first step to which competition leads the second step to which it drives is to exclude also from the selling price of the commodity at least a part of the abnormal surplusvalue created by the extension of the working day in this way an abnormally low selling price of the commodity arises at first sporadically and becomes fixed by degrees a lower selling price which henceforward becomes the constant basis of a miserable wage for an excessive workingtime as originally it was the product of these very circumstances this movement is simply indicated here as the analysis of competition does not belong to this part of our subject nevertheless the capitalist may for a moment speak for himself “in birmingham there is so much competition of masters one against another that many are obliged to do things as employers that they would otherwise be ashamed of and yet no more money is made but only the public gets the benefit” the reader will remember the two sorts of london bakers of whom one sold the bread at its full price the “fullpriced” bakers the other below its normal price “the underpriced” “the undersellers” the “fullpriced” denounced their rivals before the parliamentary committee of inquiry “they only exist now by first defrauding the public and next getting hours’ work out of their men for hours’ wages the unpaid labour of the men was made the source whereby the competition was carried on and continues so to this day the competition among the master bakers is the cause of the difficulty in getting rid of nightwork an underseller who sells his bread below the costprice according to the price of flour must make it up by getting more out of the labour of the men if i got only hours’ work out of my men and my neighbor got or he must beat me in the selling price if the men could insist on payment for overwork this would be set right a large number of those employed by the undersellers are foreigners and youths who are obliged to accept almost any wages they can obtain” this jeremiad is also interesting because it shows how the appearance only of the relations of production mirrors itself in the brain of the capitalist the capitalist does not know that the normal price of labour also includes a definite quantity of unpaid labour and that this very unpaid labour is the normal source of his gain the category of surplus labourtime does not exist at all for him since it is included in the normal working day which he thinks he has paid for in the day’s wages but overtime does exist for him the prolongation of the working day beyond the limits corresponding with the usual price of labour face to face with his underselling competitor he even insists upon extra pay for this overtime he again does not know that this extra pay includes unpaid labour just as well as does the price of the customary hour of labour for example the price of one hour of the hours’ working day is d say the valueproduct of half a workinghour whilst the price of the overtime workinghour is d or the valueproduct of of a working hour in the first case the capitalist appropriates to himself onehalf in the second onethird of the workinghour without paying for it chapter piece wages wages by the piece are nothing else than a converted form of wages by time just as wages by time are a converted form of the value or price of labourpower in piece wages it seems at first sight as if the usevalue bought from the labourer was not the function of his labourpower living labour but labour already realized in the product and as if the price of this labour was determined not as with timewages by the fraction daily value of labourpower the working day of a given number of hours but by the capacity for work of the producer the confidence that trusts in this appearance ought to receive a first severe shock from the fact that both forms of wages exist side by side simultaneously in the same branches of industry eg “the compositors of london as a general rule work by the piece timework being the exception while those in the country work by the day the exception being work by the piece the shipwrights of the port of london work by the job or piece while those of all other parts work by the day” in the same saddlery shops of london often for the same work piece wages are paid to the french timewages to the english in the regular factories in which throughout piece wages predominate particular kinds of work are unsuitable to this form of wage and are therefore paid by time but it is moreover selfevident that the difference of form in the payment of wages alters in no way their essential nature although the one form may be more favorable to the development of capitalist production than the other let the ordinary working day contain hours of which are paid unpaid let its valueproduct be shillings that of one hour’s labour therefore d let us suppose that as the result of experience a labourer who works with the average amount of intensity and skill who therefore gives in fact only the time socially necessary to the production of an article supplies in hours pieces either distinct products or measurable parts of a continuous whole then the value of these pieces after subtraction of the portion of constant capital contained in them is shillings and the value of a single piece d the labourer receives ½d per piece and thus earns in hours shillings just as with timewages it does not matter whether we assume that the labourer works hours for himself and hours for the capitalist or half of every hour for himself and the other half for the capitalist so here it does not matter whether we say that each individual piece is half paid and half unpaid for or that the price of pieces is the equivalent only of the value of the labourpower whilst in the other pieces surplusvalue is incorporated the form of piece wages is just as irrational as that of timewages whilst in our example two pieces of a commodity after subtraction of the value of the means of production consumed in them are worth d as being the product of one hour the labourer receives for them a price of d piece wages do not in fact distinctly express any relation of value it is not therefore a question of measuring the value of the piece by the workingtime incorporated in it but on the contrary of measuring the workingtime the labourer has expended by the number of pieces he has produced in timewages the labour is measured by its immediate duration in piece wages by the quantity of products in which the labour has embodied itself during a given time the price of labour time itself is finally determined by the equation value of a day’s labour daily value of labourpower piecewage is therefore only a modified form of timewage let us now consider a little more closely the characteristic peculiarities of piece wages the quality of the labour is here controlled by the work itself which must be of average perfection if the pieceprice is to be paid in full piece wages become from this point of view the most fruitful source of reductions of wages and capitalistic cheating they furnish to the capitalist an exact measure for the intensity of labour only the workingtime which is embodied in a quantum of commodities determined beforehand and experimentally fixed counts as socially necessary workingtime and is paid as such in the larger workshops of the london tailors therefore a certain piece of work a waistcoat eg is called an hour or half an hour the hour at d by practice it is known how much is the average product of one hour with new fashions repairs c a contest arises between master and labourer as to whether a particular piece of work is one hour and so on until here also experience decides similarly in the london furniture workshops c if the labourer does not possess the average capacity if he cannot in consequence supply a certain minimum of work per day he is dismissed since the quality and intensity of the work are here controlled by the form of wage itself superintendence of labour becomes in great part superfluous piece wages therefore lay the foundation of the modern “domestic labour” described above as well as of a hierarchically organized system of exploitation and oppression the latter has two fundamental forms on the one hand piece wages facilitate the interposition of parasites between the capitalist and the wagelabourer the “subletting of labour” the gain of these middlemen comes entirely from the difference between the labourprice which the capitalist pays and the part of that price which they actually allow to reach the labourer in england this system is characteristically called the “sweating system” on the other hand piecewage allows the capitalist to make a contract for so much per piece with the head labourer – in manufactures with the chief of some group in mines with the extractor of the coal in the factory with the actual machineworker – at a price for which the head labourer himself undertakes the enlisting and payment of his assistant work people the exploitation of the labourer by capital is here effected through the exploitation of the labourer by the labourer given piecewage it is naturally the personal interest of the labourer to strain his labourpower as intensely as possible this enables the capitalist to raise more easily the normal degree of intensity of labour it is moreover now the personal interest of the labourer to lengthen the working day since with it his daily or weekly wages rise this gradually brings on a reaction like that already described in timewages without reckoning that the prolongation of the working day even if the piece wage remains constant includes of necessity a fall in the price of the labour in timewages with few exceptions the same wage holds for the same kind of work whilst in piece wages though the price of the working time is measured by a certain quantity of product the day’s or week’s wage will vary with the individual differences of the labourers of whom one supplies in a given time the minimum of product only another the average a third more than the average with regard to actual receipts there is therefore great variety according to the different skill strength energy stayingpower c of the individual labourers of course this does not alter the general relations between capital and wagelabour first the individual differences balance one another in the workshop as a whole which thus supplies in a given workingtime the average product and the total wages paid will be the average wages of that particular branch of industry second the proportion between wages and surplusvalue remains unaltered since the mass of surplus labour supplied by each particular labourer corresponds with the wage received by him but the wider scope that piecewage gives to individuality tends to develop on the one hand that individuality and with it the sense of liberty independence and selfcontrol of the labourers and on the other their competition one with another piecework has therefore a tendency while raising individual wages above the average to lower this average itself but where a particular rate of piecewage has for a long time been fixed by tradition and its lowering therefore presented especial difficulties the masters in such exceptional cases sometimes had recourse to its compulsory transformation into timewages hence eg in a great strike among the ribbonweavers of coventry piecewage is finally one of the chief supports of the hoursystem described in the preceding chapter from what has been shown so far it follows that piecewage is the form of wages most in harmony with the capitalist mode of production although by no means new – it figures side by side with timewages officially in the french and english labour statutes of the th century – it only conquers a larger field for action during the period of manufacture properly socalled in the stormy youth of modern industry especially from to it served as a lever for the lengthening of the working day and the lowering of wages very important materials for the fluctuation of wages during that period are to be found in the blue books “report and evidence from the select committee on petitions respecting the corn laws” parliamentary session of and “report from the lords’ committee on the state of the growth commerce and consumption of grain and all laws relating thereto” session of here we find documentary evidence of the constant lowering of the price of labour from the beginning of the antijacobin war in the weaving industry eg piece wages had fallen so low that in spite of the very great lengthening of the working day the daily wages were then lower than before “the real earnings of the cotton weaver are now far less than they were his superiority over the common labourer which at first was very great has now almost entirely ceased indeed the difference in the wages of skillful and common labour is far less now than at any former period” how little the increased intensity and extension of labour through piece wages benefited the agricultural proletariat the following passage borrowed from a work on the side of the landlords and farmers shows “by far the greater part of agricultural operations is done by people who are hired for the day or on piecework their weekly wages are about s and although it may be assumed that a man earns on piecework under the greater stimulus to labour s or perhaps s more than on weekly wages yet it is found on calculating his total income that his loss of employment during the year outweighs this gainfurther it will generally be found that the wages of these men bear a certain proportion to the price of the necessary means of subsistence so that a man with two children is able to bring up his family without recourse to parish relief” malthus at that time remarked with reference to the facts published by parliament “i confess that i see with misgiving the great extension of the practice of piecewage really hard work during or hours of the day or for any longer time is too much for any human being” in the workshops under the factory acts piece wages become the general rule because capital can there only increase the efficacy of the working day by intensifying labour with the changing productiveness of labour the same quantum of product represents a varying workingtime therefore piecewage also varies for it is the money expression of a determined workingtime in our example above pieces were produced in hours whilst the value of the product of the hours was s the daily value of the labourpower s the price of the labourhour d and the wage for one piece ½d in one piece halfanhour’s labour was absorbed if the same working day now supplies in consequence of the doubled productiveness of labour pieces instead of and all other circumstances remain unchanged then the piecewage falls from ½d to d as every piece now only represents instead of ½ of a workinghour by ½d s and in like manner by d s in other words piecewage is lowered in the same proportion as the number of the pieces produced in the same time rises and therefore as the working time spent on the same piece falls this change in piecewage so far purely nominal leads to constant battles between capitalist and labour either because the capitalist uses it as a pretext for actually lowering the price of labour or because increased productive power of labour is accompanied by an increased intensity of the same or because the labourer takes seriously the appearance of piece wages viz that his product is paid for and not his labourpower and therefore revolts against a lowering of wages unaccompanied by a lowering in the selling price of the commodity “the operativescarefully watch the price of the raw material and the price of manufactured goods and are thus enabled to form an accurate estimate of their master’s profits” the capitalist rightly knocks on the head such pretensions as gross errors as to the nature of wagelabour he cries out against this usurping attempt to lay taxes on the advance of industry and declares roundly that the productiveness of labour does not concern the labourer at all chapter national differences of wages in the th chapter we were occupied with the manifold combinations which may bring about a change in magnitude of the value of labourpower – this magnitude being considered either absolutely or relatively ie as compared with surplusvalue whilst on the other hand the quantum of the means of subsistence in which the price of labour is realized might again undergo fluctuations independent of or different from the changes of this price as has been already said the simple translation of the value or respectively of the price of labourpower into the exoteric form of wages transforms all these laws into laws of the fluctuations of wages that which appears in these fluctuations of wages within a single country as a series of varying combinations may appear in different countries as contemporaneous difference of national wages in the comparison of the wages in different nations we must therefore take into account all the factors that determine changes in the amount of the value of labourpower the price and the extent of the prime necessaries of life as naturally and historically developed the cost of training the labourers the part played by the labour of women and children the productiveness of labour its extensive and intensive magnitude even the most superficial comparison requires the reduction first of the average daywage for the same trades in different countries to a uniform working day after this reduction to the same terms of the daywages timewage must again be translated into piecewage as the latter only can be a measure both of the productivity and the intensity of labour in every country there is a certain average intensity of labour below which the labour for the production of a commodity requires more than the socially necessary time and therefore does not reckon as labour of normal quality only a degree of intensity above the national average affects in a given country the measure of value by the mere duration of the workingtime this is not the case on the universal market whose integral parts are the individual countries the average intensity of labour changes from country to country here it is greater there less these national averages form a scale whose unit of measure is the average unit of universal labour the more intense national labour therefore as compared with the less intense produces in the same time more value which expresses itself in more money but the law of value in its international application is yet more modified by the fact that on the worldmarket the more productive national labour reckons also as the more intense so long as the more productive nation is not compelled by competition to lower the selling price of its commodities to the level of their value in proportion as capitalist production is developed in a country in the same proportion do the national intensity and productivity of labour there rise above the international level the different quantities of commodities of the same kind produced in different countries in the same workingtime have therefore unequal international values which are expressed in different prices ie in sums of money varying according to international values the relative value of money will therefore be less in the nation with more developed capitalist mode of production than in the nation with less developed it follows then that the nominal wages the equivalent of labourpower expressed in money will also be higher in the first nation than in the second which does not at all prove that this holds also for the real wages ie for the means of subsistence placed at the disposal of the labourer but even apart from these relative differences of the value of money in different countries it will be found frequently that the daily or weekly tc wage in the first nation is higher than in the second whilst the relative price of labour ie the price of labour as compared both with surplusvalue and with the value of the product stands higher in the second than in the first j w cowell member of the factory commission of after careful investigation of the spinning trade came to the conclusion that “in england wages are virtually lower to the capitalist though higher to the operative than on the continent of europe” the english factory inspector alexander redgrave in his report of oct st proves by comparative statistics with continental states that in spite of lower wages and much longer workingtime continental labour is in proportion to the product dearer than english an english manager of a cotton factory in oldenburg declares that the working time there lasted from am to pm saturdays included and that the workpeople there when under english overlookers did not supply during this time quite so much product as the english in hours but under german overlookers much less wages are much lower than in england in many cases but the number of hands in proportion to the machinery was much greater in certain departments in the proportion of mr redgrave gives very full details as to the russian cotton factories the data were given him by an english manager until recently employed there on this russian soil so fruitful of all infamies the old horrors of the early days of english factories are in full swing the managers are of course english as the native russian capitalist is of no use in factory business despite all overwork continued day and night despite the most shameful underpayment of the workpeople russian manufacture manages to vegetate only by prohibition of foreign competition i give in conclusion a comparative table of mr redgrave’s on the average number of spindles per factory and per spinner in the different countries of europe he himself remarks that he had collected these figures a few years ago and that since that time the size of the factories and the number of spindles per labourer in england has increased he supposes however an approximately equal progress in the continental countries mentioned so that the numbers given would still have their value for purposes of comparison average number of spindles per factory england average of spindles per factory france average of spindles per factory prussia average of spindles per factory belgium average of spindles per factory saxony average of spindles per factory austria average of spindles per factory switzerland average of spindles per factory average number of persons employed to spindles france one person to spindles russia one person to spindles prussia one person to spindles bavaria one person to spindles austria one person to spindles belgium one person to spindles saxony one person to spindles switzerland one person to spindles smaller states of germany one person to spindles great britain one person to spindles “this comparison” says mr redgrave “is yet more unfavorable to great britain inasmuch as there is so large a number of factories in which weaving by power is carried on in conjunction with spinning” whilst in the table the weavers are not deducted “and the factories abroad are chiefly spinning factories if it were possible to compare like with like strictly i could find many cotton spinning factories in my district in which mules containing spindles are minded by one man the minder and two assistants only turning off daily lbs of yarn measuring miles in length” it is well known that in eastern europe as well as in asia english companies have undertaken the construction of railways and have in making them employed side by side with the native labourers a certain number of english workingmen compelled by practical necessity they thus have had to take into account the national difference in the intensity of labour but this has brought them no loss their experience shows that even if the height of wages corresponds more or less with the average intensity of labour the relative price of labour varies generally in the inverse direction in an “essay on the rate of wages” one of his first economic writings h carey tries to prove that the wages of the different nations are directly proportional to the degree of productiveness of the national working days in order to draw from this international relation the conclusion that wages everywhere rise and fall in proportion to the productiveness of labour the whole of our analysis of the production of surplusvalue shows the absurdity of this conclusion even if carey himself had proved his premises instead of after his usual uncritical and superficial fashion shuffling to and fro a confused mass of statistical materials the best of it is that he does not assert that things actually are as they ought to be according to his theory for state intervention has falsified the natural economic relations the different national wages must be reckoned therefore as if that part of each that goes to the state in the form of taxes came to the labourer himself ought not mr carey to consider further whether those “state expenses” are not the “natural” fruits of capitalistic development the reasoning is quite worthy of the man who first declared the relations of capitalist production to be eternal laws of nature and reason whose free harmonious working is only disturbed by the intervention of the state in order afterwards to discover that the diabolical influence of england on the world market an influence which it appears does not spring from the natural laws of capitalist production necessitates state intervention ie the protection of those laws of nature and reason by the state alias the system of protection he discovered further that the theorems of ricardo and others in which existing social antagonisms and contradictions are formulated are not the ideal product of the real economic movement but on the contrary that the real antagonisms of capitalist production in england and elsewhere are the result of the theories of ricardo and others finally he discovered that it is in the last resort commerce that destroys the inborn beauties and harmonies of the capitalist mode of production a step further and he will perhaps discover that the one evil in capitalist production is capital itself only a man with such atrocious want of the critical faculty and such spurious erudition deserved in spite of his protectionist heresy to become the secret source of the harmonious wisdom of a bastiat and of all the other freetrade optimists of today part the accumulation of capital the conversion of a sum of money into means of production and labourpower is the first step taken by the quantum of value that is going to function as capital this conversion takes place in the market within the sphere of circulation the second step the process of production is complete so soon as the means of production have been converted into commodities whose value exceeds that of their component parts and therefore contains the capital originally advanced plus a surplusvalue these commodities must then be thrown into circulation they must be sold their value realised in money this money afresh converted into capital and so over and over again this circular movement in which the same phases are continually gone through in succession forms the circulation of capital the first condition of accumulation is that the capitalist must have contrived to sell his commodities and to reconvert into capital the greater part of the money so received in the following pages we shall assume that capital circulates in its normal way the detailed analysis of the process will be found in book ii the capitalist who produces surplusvalue – ie who extracts unpaid labour directly from the labourers and fixes it in commodities is indeed the first appropriator but by no means the ultimate owner of this surplusvalue he has to share it with capitalists with landowners c who fulfil other functions in the complex of social production surplusvalue therefore splits up into various parts its fragments fall to various categories of persons and take various forms independent the one of the other such as profit interest merchants’ profit rent c it is only in book iii that we can take in hand these modified forms of surplusvalue on the one hand then we assume that the capitalist sells at their value the commodities he has produced without concerning ourselves either about the new forms that capital assumes while in the sphere of circulation or about the concrete conditions of reproduction hidden under these forms on the other hand we treat the capitalist producer as owner of the entire surplusvalue or better perhaps as the representative of all the sharers with him in the booty we therefore first of all consider accumulation from an abstract point of view – ie as a mere phase in the actual process of production so far as accumulation takes place the capitalist must have succeeded in selling his commodities and in reconverting the salemoney into capital moreover the breakingup of surplusvalue into fragments neither alters its nature nor the conditions under which it becomes an element of accumulation whatever be the proportion of surplusvalue which the industrial capitalist retains for himself or yields up to others he is the one who in the first instance appropriates it we therefore assume no more than what actually takes place on the other hand the simple fundamental form of the process of accumulation is obscured by the incident of the circulation which brings it about and by the splitting up of surplusvalue an exact analysis of the process therefore demands that we should for a time disregard all phenomena that hide the play of its inner mechanism chapter simple reproduction whatever the form of the process of production in a society it must be a continuous process must continue to go periodically through the same phases a society can no more cease to produce than it can cease to consume when viewed therefore as a connected whole and as flowing on with incessant renewal every social process of production is at the same time a process of reproduction the conditions of production are also those of reproduction no society can go on producing in other words no society can reproduce unless it constantly reconverts a part of its products into means of production or elements of fresh products all other circumstances remaining the same the only mode by which it can reproduce its wealth and maintain it at one level is by replacing the means of production – ie the instruments of labour the raw material and the auxiliary substances consumed in the course of the year – by an equal quantity of the same kind of articles these must be separated from the mass of the yearly products and thrown afresh into the process of production hence a definite portion of each year’s product belongs to the domain of production destined for productive consumption from the very first this portion exists for the most part in the shape of articles totally unfitted for individual consumption if production be capitalistic in form so too will be reproduction just as in the former the labour process figures but as a means towards the selfexpansion of capital so in the latter it figures but as a means of reproducing as capital – ie as selfexpanding value – the value advanced it is only because his money constantly functions as capital that the economic guise of a capitalist attaches to a man if for instance a sum of £ has this year been converted into capital and produced a surplusvalue of £ it must continue during next year and subsequent years to repeat the same operation as a periodic increment of the capital advanced or periodic fruit of capital in process surplusvalue acquires the form of a revenue flowing out of capital if this revenue serve the capitalist only as a fund to provide for his consumption and be spent as periodically as it is gained then caeteris paribus simple reproduction will take place and although this reproduction is a mere repetition of the process of production on the old scale yet this mere repetition or continuity gives a new character to the process or rather causes the disappearance of some apparent characteristics which it possessed as an isolated discontinuous process the purchase of labourpower for a fixed period is the prelude to the process of production and this prelude is constantly repeated when the stipulated term comes to an end when a definite period of production such as a week or a month has elapsed but the labourer is not paid until after he has expended his labourpower and realised in commodities not only its value but surplusvalue he has therefore produced not only surplusvalue which we for the present regard as a fund to meet the private consumption of the capitalist but he has also produced before it flows back to him in the shape of wages the fund out of which he himself is paid the variable capital and his employment lasts only so long as he continues to reproduce this fund hence that formula of the economists referred to in chapter xviii which represents wages as a share in the product itself what flows back to the labourer in the shape of wages is a portion of the product that is continuously reproduced by him the capitalist it is true pays him in money but this money is merely the transmuted form of the product of his labour while he is converting a portion of the means of production into products a portion of his former product is being turned into money it is his labour of last week or of last year that pays for his labourpower this week or this year the illusion begotten by the intervention of money vanishes immediately if instead of taking a single capitalist and a single labourer we take the class of capitalists and the class of labourers as a whole the capitalist class is constantly giving to the labouring class ordernotes in the form of money on a portion of the commodities produced by the latter and appropriated by the former the labourers give these ordernotes back just as constantly to the capitalist class and in this way get their share of their own product the transaction is veiled by the commodity form of the product and the money form of the commodity variable capital is therefore only a particular historical form of appearance of the fund for providing the necessaries of life or the labourfund which the labourer requires for the maintenance of himself and family and which whatever be the system of social production he must himself produce and reproduce if the labourfund constantly flows to him in the form of money that pays for his labour it is because the product he has created moves constantly away from him in the form of capital but all this does not alter the fact that it is the labourer’s own labour realised in a product which is advanced to him by the capitalist let us take a peasant liable to do compulsory service for his lord he works on his own land with his own means of production for say days a week the other days he does forced work on the lord’s domain he constantly reproduces his own labourfund which never in his case takes the form of a money payment for his labour advanced by another person but in return his unpaid forced labour for the lord on its side never acquires the character of voluntary paid labour if one fine morning the lord appropriates to himself the land the cattle the seed in a word the means of production of this peasant the latter will thenceforth be obliged to sell his labourpower to the lord he will ceteris paribus labour days a week as before for himself for his lord who thenceforth becomes a wagespaying capitalist as before he will use up the means of production as means of production and transfer their value to the product as before a definite portion of the product will be devoted to reproduction but from the moment that the forced labour is changed into wage labour from that moment the labourfund which the peasant himself continues as before to produce and reproduce takes the form of a capital advanced in the form of wages by the lord the bourgeois economist whose narrow mind is unable to separate the form of appearance from the thing that appears shuts his eyes to the fact that it is but here and there on the face of the earth that even nowadays the labour fund crops up in the form of capital variable capital it is true only then loses its character of a value advanced out of the capitalist’s funds when we view the process of capitalist production in the flow of its constant renewal but that process must have had a beginning of some kind from our present standpoint it therefore seems likely that the capitalist once upon a time became possessed of money by some accumulation that took place independently of the unpaid labour of others and that this was therefore how he was enabled to frequent the market as a buyer of labourpower however this may be the mere continuity of the process the simple reproduction brings about some other wonderful changes which affect not only the variable but the total capital if a capital of £ beget yearly a surplusvalue of £ and if this surplusvalue be consumed every year it is clear that at the end of years the surplusvalue consumed will amount to × £ or the £ originally advanced if only a part say one half were consumed the same result would follow at the end of years since × £ £ general rule the value of the capital advanced divided by the surplusvalue annually consumed gives the number of years or reproduction periods at the expiration of which the capital originally advanced has been consumed by the capitalist and has disappeared the capitalist thinks that he is consuming the produce of the unpaid labour of others ie the surplusvalue and is keeping intact his original capital but what he thinks cannot alter facts after the lapse of a certain number of years the capital value he then possesses is equal to the sum total of the surplusvalue appropriated by him during those years and the total value he has consumed is equal to that of his original capital it is true he has in hand a capital whose amount has not changed and of which a part viz the buildings machinery c were already there when the work of his business began but what we have to do with here is not the material elements but the value of that capital when a person gets through all his property by taking upon himself debts equal to the value of that property it is clear that his property represents nothing but the sum total of his debts and so it is with the capitalist when he has consumed the equivalent of his original capital the value of his present capital represents nothing but the total amount of the surplusvalue appropriated by him without payment not a single atom of the value of his old capital continues to exist apart then from all accumulation the mere continuity of the process of production in other words simple reproduction sooner or later and of necessity converts every capital into accumulated capital or capitalised surplusvalue even if that capital was originally acquired by the personal labour of its employer it sooner or later becomes value appropriated without an equivalent the unpaid labour of others materialised either in money or in some other object we saw in chapt ivvi that in order to convert money into capital something more is required than the production and circulation of commodities we saw that on the one side the possessor of value or money on the other the possessor of the valuecreating substance on the one side the possessor of the means of production and subsistence on the other the possessor of nothing but labourpower must confront one another as buyer and seller the separation of labour from its product of subjective labourpower from the objective conditions of labour was therefore the real foundation in fact and the startingpoint of capitalist production but that which at first was but a startingpoint becomes by the mere continuity of the process by simple reproduction the peculiar result constantly renewed and perpetuated of capitalist production on the one hand the process of production incessantly converts material wealth into capital into means of creating more wealth and means of enjoyment for the capitalist on the other hand the labourer on quitting the process is what he was on entering it a source of wealth but devoid of all means of making that wealth his own since before entering on the process his own labour has already been alienated from himself by the sale of his labourpower has been appropriated by the capitalist and incorporated with capital it must during the process be realised in a product that does not belong to him since the process of production is also the process by which the capitalist consumes labourpower the product of the labourer is incessantly converted not only into commodities but into capital into value that sucks up the valuecreating power into means of subsistence that buy the person of the labourer into means of production that command the producers the labourer therefore constantly produces material objective wealth but in the form of capital of an alien power that dominates and exploits him and the capitalist as constantly produces labourpower but in the form of a subjective source of wealth separated from the objects in and by which it can alone be realised in short he produces the labourer but as a wage labourer this incessant reproduction this perpetuation of the labourer is the sine quâ non of capitalist production the labourer consumes in a twofold way while producing he consumes by his labour the means of production and converts them into products with a higher value than that of the capital advanced this is his productive consumption it is at the same time consumption of his labourpower by the capitalist who bought it on the other hand the labourer turns the money paid to him for his labourpower into means of subsistence this is his individual consumption the labourer’s productive consumption and his individual consumption are therefore totally distinct in the former he acts as the motive power of capital and belongs to the capitalist in the latter he belongs to himself and performs his necessary vital functions outside the process of production the result of the one is that the capitalist lives of the other that the labourer lives when treating of the working day we saw that the labourer is often compelled to make his individual consumption a mere incident of production in such a case he supplies himself with necessaries in order to maintain his labourpower just as coal and water are supplied to the steamengine and oil to the wheel his means of consumption in that case are the mere means of consumption required by a means of production his individual consumption is directly productive consumption this however appears to be an abuse not essentially appertaining to capitalist production the matter takes quite another aspect when we contemplate not the single capitalist and the single labourer but the capitalist class and the labouring class not an isolated process of production but capitalist production in full swing and on its actual social scale by converting part of his capital into labourpower the capitalist augments the value of his entire capital he kills two birds with one stone he profits not only by what he receives from but by what he gives to the labourer the capital given in exchange for labourpower is converted into necessaries by the consumption of which the muscles nerves bones and brains of existing labourers are reproduced and new labourers are begotten within the limits of what is strictly necessary the individual consumption of the working class is therefore the reconversion of the means of subsistence given by capital in exchange for labourpower into fresh labourpower at the disposal of capital for exploitation it is the production and reproduction of that means of production so indispensable to the capitalist the labourer himself the individual consumption of the labourer whether it proceed within the workshop or outside it whether it be part of the process of production or not forms therefore a factor of the production and reproduction of capital just as cleaning machinery does whether it be done while the machinery is working or while it is standing the fact that the labourer consumes his means of subsistence for his own purposes and not to please the capitalist has no bearing on the matter the consumption of food by a beast of burden is none the less a necessary factor in the process of production because the beast enjoys what it eats the maintenance and reproduction of the working class is and must ever be a necessary condition to the reproduction of capital but the capitalist may safely leave its fulfilment to the labourer’s instincts of selfpreservation and of propagation all the capitalist cares for is to reduce the labourer’s individual consumption as far as possible to what is strictly necessary and he is far away from imitating those brutal south americans who force their labourers to take the more substantial rather than the less substantial kind of food hence both the capitalist and his ideological representative the political economist consider that part alone of the labourer’s individual consumption to be productive which is requisite for the perpetuation of the class and which therefore must take place in order that the capitalist may have labourpower to consume what the labourer consumes for his own pleasure beyond that part is unproductive consumption if the accumulation of capital were to cause a rise of wages and an increase in the labourer’s consumption unaccompanied by increase in the consumption of labourpower by capital the additional capital would be consumed unproductively in reality the individual consumption of the labourer is unproductive as regards himself for it reproduces nothing but the needy individual it is productive to the capitalist and to the state since it is the production of the power that creates their wealth from a social point of view therefore the working class even when not directly engaged in the labour process is just as much an appendage of capital as the ordinary instruments of labour even its individual consumption is within certain limits a mere factor in the process of production that process however takes good care to prevent these selfconscious instruments from leaving it in the lurch for it removes their product as fast as it is made from their pole to the opposite pole of capital individual consumption provides on the one hand the means for their maintenance and reproduction on the other hand it secures by the annihilation of the necessaries of life the continued reappearance of the workman in the labourmarket the roman slave was held by fetters the wage labourer is bound to his owner by invisible threads the appearance of independence is kept up by means of a constant change of employers and by the fictio juris of a contract in former times capital resorted to legislation whenever necessary to enforce its proprietary rights over the free labourer for instance down to the emigration of mechanics employed in machine making was in england forbidden under grievous pains and penalties the reproduction of the working class carries with it the accumulation of skill that is handed down from one generation to another to what extent the capitalist reckons the existence of such a skilled class among the factors of production that belong to him by right and to what extent he actually regards it as the reality of his variable capital is seen so soon as a crisis threatens him with its loss in consequence of the civil war in the united states and of the accompanying cotton famine the majority of the cotton operatives in lancashire were as is well known thrown out of work both from the working class itself and from other ranks of society there arose a cry for state aid or for voluntary national subscriptions in order to enable the “superfluous” hands to emigrate to the colonies or to the united states thereupon the times published on the th march a letter from edmund potter a former president of the manchester chamber of commerce this letter was rightly called in the house of commons the manufacturers’ manifesto we cull here a few characteristic passages in which the proprietary rights of capital over labourpower are unblushingly asserted “he” the man out of work “may be told the supply of cottonworkers is too large and must in fact be reduced by a third perhaps and that then there will be a healthy demand for the remaining twothirds public opinion urges emigration the master cannot willingly see his labour supply being removed he may think and perhaps justly that it is both wrong and unsound but if the public funds are to be devoted to assist emigration he bas a right to be heard and perhaps to protest” mr potter then shows how useful the cotton trade is how the “trade has undoubtedly drawn the surpluspopulation from ireland and from the agricultural districts” how immense is its extent how in the year it yielded ths of the total english exports how after a few years it will again expand by the extension of the market particularly of the indian market and by calling forth a plentiful supply of cotton at d per lb he then continues “some time one two or three years it may be will produce the quantity the question i would put then is this – is the trade worth retaining is it worth while to keep the machinery he means the living labour machines in order and is it not the greatest folly to think of parting with that i think it is i allow that the workers are not a property not the property of lancashire and the masters but they are the strength of both they are the mental and trained power which cannot be replaced for a generation the mere machinery which they work might much of it be beneficially replaced nay improved in a twelvemonth encourage or allow the workingpower to emigrate and what of the capitalist take away the cream of the workers and fixed capital will depreciate in a great degree and the floating will not subject itself to a struggle with the short supply of inferior labour we are told the workers wish it” emigration “very natural it is that they should do so reduce compress the cotton trade by taking away its working power and reducing their wages expenditure say onefifth or five millions and what then would happen to the class above the small shopkeepers and what of the rents the cottage rents trace out the effects upwards to the small farmer the better householder and the landowner and say if there could be any suggestion more suicidal to all classes of the country than by enfeebling a nation by exporting the best of its manufacturing population and destroying the value of some of its most productive capital and enrichment i advise a loan of five or six millions sterling extending it may be over two or three years administered by special commissioners added to the boards of guardians in the cotton districts under special legislative regulations enforcing some occupation or labour as a means of keeping up at least the moral standard of the recipients of the loan can anything be worse for landowners or masters than parting with the best of the workers and demoralising and disappointing the rest by an extended depletive emigration a depletion of capital and value in an entire province” potter the chosen mouthpiece of the manufacturers distinguishes two sorts of “machinery” each of which belongs to the capitalist and of which one stands in his factory the other at nighttime and on sundays is housed outside the factory in cottages the one is inanimate the other living the inanimate machinery not only wears out and depreciates from day to day but a great part of it becomes so quickly superannuated by constant technical progress that it can be replaced with advantage by new machinery after a few months the living machinery on the contrary gets better the longer it lasts and in proportion as the skill handed from one generation to another accumulates the times answered the cotton lord as follows “mr edmund potter is so impressed with the exceptional and supreme importance of the cotton masters that in order to preserve this class and perpetuate their profession he would keep half a million of the labouring class confined in a great moral workhouse against their will ‘is the trade worth retaining’ asks mr potter ‘certainly by all honest means it is’ we answer ‘is it worth while keeping the machinery in order’ again asks mr potter here we hesitate by the ‘machinery’ mr potter means the human machinery for he goes on to protest that he does not mean to use them as an absolute property we must confess that we do not think it ‘worth while’ or even possible to keep the human machinery in order – that is to shut it up and keep it oiled till it is wanted human machinery will rust under inaction oil and rub it as you may moreover the human machinery will as we have just seen get the steam up of its own accord and burst or run amuck in our great towns it might as mr potter says require some time to reproduce the workers but having machinists and capitalists at hand we could always find thrifty hard industrious men wherewith to improvise more master manufacturers than we can ever want mr potter talks of the trade reviving ‘in one two or three years’ and he asks us not ‘to encourage or allow the working power to emigrate’ he says that it is very natural the workers should wish to emigrate but he thinks that in spite of their desire the nation ought to keep this half million of workers with their dependents shut up in the cotton districts and as a necessary consequence he must of course think that the nation ought to keep down their discontent by force and sustain them by alms – and upon the chance that the cotton masters may some day want them the time is come when the great public opinion of these islands must operate to save this ‘working power’ from those who would deal with it as they would deal with iron and coal and cotton” the times’ article was only a jeu d’esprit the “great public opinion” was in fact of mr potter’s opinion that the factory operatives are part of the movable fittings of a factory their emigration was prevented they were locked up in that “moral workhouse” the cotton districts and they form as before “the strength” of the cotton manufacturers of lancashire capitalist production therefore of itself reproduces the separation between labourpower and the means of labour it thereby reproduces and perpetuates the condition for exploiting the labourer it incessantly forces him to sell his labourpower in order to live and enables the capitalist to purchase labourpower in order that he may enrich himself it is no longer a mere accident that capitalist and labourer confront each other in the market as buyer and seller it is the process itself that incessantly hurls back the labourer on to the market as a vendor of his labourpower and that incessantly converts his own product into a means by which another man can purchase him in reality the labourer belongs to capital before he has sold himself to capital his economic bondage is both brought about and concealed by the periodic sale of himself by his change of masters and by the oscillations in the marketprice of labourpower capitalist production therefore under its aspect of a continuous connected process of a process of reproduction produces not only commodities not only surplusvalue but it also produces and reproduces the capitalist relation on the one side the capitalist on the other the wage labourer chapter conversion of surplusvalue into capital section capitalist production on a progressively increasing scale transition of the laws of property that characterise production of commodities into laws of capitalist appropriation hitherto we have investigated how surplusvalue emanates from capital we have now to see how capital arises from surplusvalue employing surplusvalue as capital reconverting it into capital is called accumulation of capital first let us consider this transaction from the standpoint of the individual capitalist suppose a spinner to have advanced a capital of £ of which fourfifths £ are laid out in cotton machinery c and onefifth £ in wages let him produce lbs of yarn annually having a value of £ the rate of surplusvalue being the surplusvalue lies in the surplus or net product of lbs of yarn onesixth of the gross product with a value of £ which will be realised by a sale £ is £ we can neither see nor smell in this sum of money a trace of surplusvalue when we know that a given value is surplusvalue we know how its owner came by it but that does not alter the nature either of value or of money in order to convert this additional sum of £ into capital the masterspinner will all circumstances remaining as before advance fourfifths of it £ in the purchase of cotton c and onefifth £ in the purchase of additional spinners who will find in the market the necessaries of life whose value the master has advanced to them then the new capital of £ functions in the spinning mill and brings in in its turn a surplusvalue of £ the capital value was originally advanced in the money form the surplusvalue on the contrary is originally the value of a definite portion of the gross product if this gross product be sold converted into money the capital value regains its original form from this moment the capital value and the surplusvalue are both of them sums of money and their reconversion into capital takes place in precisely the same way the one as well as the other is laid out by the capitalist in the purchase of commodities that place him in a position to begin afresh the fabrication of his goods and this time on an extended scale but in order to be able to buy those commodities he must find them ready in the market his own yarns circulate only because he brings his annual product to market as all other capitalists likewise do with their commodities but these commodities before coming to market were part of the general annual product part of the total mass of objects of every kind into which the sum of the individual capitals ie the total capital of society had been converted in the course of the year and of which each capitalist had in hand only an aliquot part the transactions in the market effectuate only the interchange of the individual components of this annual product transfer them from one hand to another but can neither augment the total annual production nor alter the nature of the objects produced hence the use that can be made of the total annual product depends entirely upon its own composition but in no way upon circulation the annual production must in the first place furnish all those objects use values from which the material components of capital used up in the course of the year have to be replaced deducting these there remains the net or surplusproduct in which the surplusvalue lies and of what does this surplusproduct consist only of things destined to satisfy the wants and desires of the capitalist class things which consequently enter into the consumption fund of the capitalists were that the case the cup of surplusvalue would be drained to the very dregs and nothing but simple reproduction would ever take place to accumulate it is necessary to convert a portion of the surplusproduct into capital but we cannot except by a miracle convert into capital anything but such articles as can be employed in the labour process ie means of production and such further articles as are suitable for the sustenance of the labourer ie means of subsistence consequently a part of the annual surplus labour must have been applied to the production of additional means of production and subsistence over and above the quantity of these things required to replace the capital advanced in one word surplusvalue is convertible into capital solely because the surplusproduct whose value it is already comprises the material elements of new capital now in order to allow of these elements actually functioning as capital the capitalist class requires additional labour if the exploitation of the labourers already employed do not increase either extensively or intensively then additional labourpower must be found for this the mechanism of capitalist production provides beforehand by converting the working class into a class dependent on wages a class whose ordinary wages suffice not only for its maintenance but for its increase it is only necessary for capital to incorporate this additional labourpower annually supplied by the working class in the shape of labourers of all ages with the surplus means of production comprised in the annual produce and the conversion of surplusvalue into capital is complete from a concrete point of view accumulation resolves itself into the reproduction of capital on a progressively increasing scale the circle in which simple reproduction moves alters its form and to use sismondi’s expression changes into a spiral let us now return to our illustration it is the old story abraham begat isaac isaac begat jacob and so on the original capital of £ brings in a surplusvalue of £ which is capitalised the new capital of £ brings in a surplusvalue of £ and this too is capitalised converted into a second additional capital which in its turn produces a further surplusvalue of £ and so the ball rolls on we here leave out of consideration the portion of the surplusvalue consumed by the capitalist just as little does it concern us for the moment whether the additional capital is joined on to the original capital or is separated from it to function independently whether the same capitalist who accumulated it employs it or whether he hands it over to another this only we must not forget that by the side of the newlyformed capital the original capital continues to reproduce itself and to produce surplusvalue and that this is also true of all accumulated capital and the additional capital engendered by it the original capital was formed by the advance of £ how did the owner become possessed of it “by his own labour and that of his forefathers” answer unanimously the spokesmen of political economy and in fact their supposition appears the only one consonant with the laws of the production of commodities but it is quite otherwise with regard to the additional capital of £ how that originated we know perfectly well there is not one single atom of its value that does not owe its existence to unpaid labour the means of production with which the additional labourpower is incorporated as well as the necessaries with which the labourers are sustained are nothing but component parts of the surplusproduct of the tribute annually exacted from the working class by the capitalist class though the latter with a portion of that tribute purchases the additional labourpower even at its full price so that equivalent is exchanged for equivalent yet the transaction is for all that only the old dodge of every conqueror who buys commodities from the conquered with the money he has robbed them of if the additional capital employs the person who produced it this producer must not only continue to augment the value of the original capital but must buy back the fruits of his previous labour with more labour than they cost when viewed as a transaction between the capitalist class and the working class it makes no difference that additional labourers are employed by means of the unpaid labour of the previously employed labourers the capitalist may even convert the additional capital into a machine that throws the producers of that capital out of work and that replaces them by a few children in every case the working class creates by the surplus labour of one year the capital destined to employ additional labour in the following year and this is what is called creating capital out of capital the accumulation of the first additional capital of £ presupposes a value of £ belonging to the capitalist by virtue of his “primitive labour” and advanced by him the second additional capital of £ presupposes on the contrary only the previous accumulation of the £ of which the £ is the surplusvalue capitalised the ownership of past unpaid labour is thenceforth the sole condition for the appropriation of living unpaid labour on a constantly increasing scale the more the capitalist has accumulated the more is he able to accumulate in so far as the surplusvalue of which the additional capital no consists is the result of the purchase of labourpower with part of the original capital a purchase that conformed to the laws of the exchange of commodities and that from a legal standpoint presupposes nothing beyond the free disposal on the part of the labourer of his own capacities and on the part of the owner of money or commodities of the values that belong to him in so far as the additional capital no c is the mere result of no and therefore a consequence of the above conditions in so far as each single transaction invariably conforms to the laws of the exchange of commodities the capitalist buying labourpower the labourer selling it and we will assume at its real value in so far as all this is true it is evident that the laws of appropriation or of private property laws that are based on the production and circulation of commodities become by their own inner and inexorable dialectic changed into their very opposite the exchange of equivalents the original operation with which we started has now become turned round in such a way that there is only an apparent exchange this is owing to the fact first that the capital which is exchanged for labourpower is itself but a portion of the product of others’ labour appropriated without an equivalent and secondly that this capital must not only be replaced by its producer but replaced together with an added surplus the relation of exchange subsisting between capitalist and labourer becomes a mere semblance appertaining to the process of circulation a mere form foreign to the real nature of the transaction and only mystifying it the ever repeated purchase and sale of labourpower is now the mere form what really takes place is this – the capitalist again and again appropriates without equivalent a portion of the previously materialised labour of others and exchanges it for a greater quantity of living labour at first the rights of property seemed to us to be based on a man’s own labour at least some such assumption was necessary since only commodityowners with equal rights confronted each other and the sole means by which a man could become possessed of the commodities of others was by alienating his own commodities and these could be replaced by labour alone now however property turns out to be the right on the part of the capitalist to appropriate the unpaid labour of others or its product and to be the impossibility on the part of the labourer of appropriating his own product the separation of property from labour has become the necessary consequence of a law that apparently originated in their identity therefore however much the capitalist mode of appropriation may seem to fly in the face of the original laws of commodity production it nevertheless arises not from a violation but on the contrary from the application of these laws let us make this clear once more by briefly reviewing the consecutive phases of motion whose culminating point is capitalist accumulation we saw in the first place that the original conversion of a sum of values into capital was achieved in complete accordance with the laws of exchange one party to the contract sells his labourpower the other buys it the former receives the value of his commodity whose use value – labour – is thereby alienated to the buyer means of production which already belong to the latter are then transformed by him with the aid of labour equally belonging to him into a new product which is likewise lawfully his the value of this product includes first the value of the usedup means of production useful labour cannot consume these means of production without transferring their value to the new product but to be saleable labourpower must be capable of supplying useful labour in the branch of industry in which it is to be employed the value of the new product further includes the equivalent of the value of the labourpower together with a surplusvalue this is so because the value of the labourpower – sold for a definite length of time say a day a week etc – is less than the value created by its use during that time but the worker has received payment for the exchangevalue of his labourpower and by so doing has alienated its use value – this being the case in every sale and purchase the fact that this particular commodity labourpower possesses the peculiar use value of supplying labour and therefore of creating value cannot affect the general law of commodity production if therefore the magnitude of value advanced in wages is not merely found again in the product but is found there augmented by a surplusvalue this is not because the seller has been defrauded for he has really received the value of his commodity it is due solely to the fact that this commodity has been used up by the buyer the law of exchange requires equality only between the exchangevalues of the commodities given in exchange for one another from the very outset it presupposes even a difference between their use values and it has nothing whatever to do with their consumption which only begins after the deal is closed and executed thus the original conversion of money into capital is achieved in the most exact accordance with the economic laws of commodity production and with the right of property derived from them nevertheless its result is that the product belongs to the capitalist and not to the worker that the value of this product includes besides the value of the capital advanced a surplusvalue which costs the worker labour but the capitalist nothing and which none the less becomes the legitimate property of the capitalist that the worker has retained his labourpower and can sell it anew if he can find a buyer simple reproduction is only the periodical repetition of this first operation each time money is converted afresh into capital thus the law is not broken on the contrary it is merely enabled to operate continuously “several successive acts of exchange have only made the last represent the first” sismondi “nouveaux principes etc” p and yet we have seen that simple reproduction suffices to stamp this first operation in so far as it is conceived as an isolated process with a totally changed character “of those who share the national income among themselves the one side the workers acquire every year a fresh right to their share by fresh work the others the capitalists have already acquired by work done originally a permanent right to their share” sismondi l c pp it is indeed notorious that the sphere of labour is not the only one in which primogeniture works miracles nor does it matter if simple reproduction is replaced by reproduction on an extended scale by accumulation in the former case the capitalist squanders the whole surplusvalue in dissipation in the latter he demonstrates his bourgeois virtue by consuming only a portion of it and converting the rest into money the surplusvalue is his property it has never belonged to anyone else if he advances it for the purposes of production the advances made come from his own funds exactly as on the day when he first entered the market the fact that on this occasion the funds are derived from the unpaid labour of his workers makes absolutely no difference if worker b is paid out of the surplusvalue which worker a produced then in the first place a furnished that surplusvalue without having the just price of his commodity cut by a halfpenny and in the second place the transaction is no concern of b’s whatever what b claims and has a right to claim is that the capitalist should pay him the value of his labourpower “both were still gainers the worker because he was advanced the fruits of his labour” should read of the unpaid labour of other workers “before the work was done” should read before his own labour had borne fruit “the employer le maître because the labour of this worker was worth more than his wages” should read produced more value than the value of his wages sismondi l c p to be sure the matter looks quite different if we consider capitalist production in the uninterrupted flow of its renewal and if in place of the individual capitalist and the individual worker we view in their totality the capitalist class and the working class confronting each other but in so doing we should be applying standards entirely foreign to commodity production only buyer and seller mutually independent face each other in commodity production the relations between them cease on the day when the term stipulated in the contract they concluded expires if the transaction is repeated it is repeated as the result of a new agreement which has nothing to do with the previous one and which only by chance brings the same seller together again with the same buyer if therefore commodity production or one of its associated processes is to be judged according to its own economic laws we must consider each act of exchange by itself apart from any connexion with the act of exchange preceding it and that following it and since sales and purchases are negotiated solely between particular individuals it is not admissible to seek here for relations between whole social classes however long a series of periodical reproductions and preceding accumulations the capital functioning today may have passed through it always preserves its original virginity so long as the laws of exchange are observed in every single act of exchange the mode of appropriation can be completely revolutionised without in any way affecting the property rights which correspond to commodity production these same rights remain in force both at the outset when the product belongs to its producer who exchanging equivalent for equivalent can enrich himself only by his own labour and also in the period of capitalism when social wealth becomes to an everincreasing degree the property of those who are in a position to appropriate continually and ever afresh the unpaid labour of others this result becomes inevitable from the moment there is a free sale by the labourer himself of labourpower as a commodity but it is also only from then onwards that commodity production is generalised and becomes the typical form of production it is only from then onwards that from the first every product is produced for sale and all wealth produced goes through the sphere of circulation only when and where wage labour is its basis does commodity production impose itself upon society as a whole but only then and there also does it unfold all its hidden potentialities to say that the supervention of wage labour adulterates commodity production is to say that commodity production must not develop if it is to remain unadulterated to the extent that commodity production in accordance with its own inherent laws develops further into capitalist production the property laws of commodity production change into the laws of capitalist appropriation we have seen that even in the case of simple reproduction all capital whatever its original source becomes converted into accumulated capital capitalised surplusvalue but in the flood of production all the capital originally advanced becomes a vanishing quantity magnitudo evanescens in the mathematical sense compared with the directly accumulated capital ie with the surplusvalue or surplusproduct that is reconverted into capital whether it functions in the hands of its accumulator or in those of others hence political economy describes capital in general as “accumulated wealth” converted surplusvalue or revenue “that is employed over again in the production of surplusvalue” and the capitalist as “the owner of surplusvalue” it is merely another way of expressing the same thing to say that all existing capital is accumulated or capitalised interest for interest is a mere fragment of surplusvalue section erroneous conception by political economy of reproduction on a progressively increasing scale before we further investigate accumulation or the reconversion of surplusvalue into capital we must brush on one side an ambiguity introduced by the classical economists just as little as the commodities that the capitalist buys with a part of the surplusvalue for his own consumption serve the purpose of production and of creation of value so little is the labour that he buys for the satisfaction of his natural and social requirements productive labour instead of converting surplusvalue into capital he on the contrary by the purchase of those commodities and that labour consumes or expends it as revenue in the face of the habitual mode of life of the old feudal nobility which as hegel rightly says “consists in consuming what is in hand” and more especially displays itself in the luxury of personal retainers it was extremely important for bourgeois economy to promulgate the doctrine that accumulation of capital is the first duty of every citizen and to preach without ceasing that a man cannot accumulate if he eats up all his revenue instead of spending a good part of it in the acquisition of additional productive labourers who bring in more than they cost on the other hand the economists had to contend against the popular prejudice that confuses capitalist production with hoarding and fancies that accumulated wealth is either wealth that is rescued from being destroyed in its existing form ie from being consumed or wealth that is withdrawn from circulation exclusion of money from circulation would also exclude absolutely its selfexpansion as capital while accumulation of a hoard in the shape of commodities would be sheer tomfoolery the accumulation of commodities in great masses is the result either of overproduction or of a stoppage of circulation it is true that the popular mind is impressed by the sight on the one hand of the mass of goods that are stored up for gradual consumption by the rich and on the other hand by the formation of reserve stocks the latter a phenomenon that is common to all modes of production and on which we shall dwell for a moment when we come to analyse circulation classical economy is therefore quite right when it maintains that the consumption of surplusproducts by productive instead of by unproductive labourers is a characteristic feature of the process of accumulation but at this point the mistakes also begin adam smith has made it the fashion to represent accumulation as nothing more than consumption of surplus products by productive labourers which amounts to saying that the capitalising of surplusvalue consists in merely turning surplusvalue into labourpower let us see what ricardo eg says “it must be understood that all the productions of a country are consumed but it makes the greatest difference imaginable whether they are consumed by those who reproduce or by those who do not reproduce another value when we say that revenue is saved and added to capital what we mean is that the portion of revenue so said to be added to capital is consumed by productive instead of unproductive labourers there can be no greater error than in supposing that capital is increased by nonconsumption” there can be no greater error than that which ricardo and all subsequent economists repeat after a smith viz that “the part of revenue of which it is said it has been added to capital is consumed by productive labourers” according to this all surplusvalue that is changed into capital becomes variable capital so far from this being the case the surplusvalue like the original capital divides itself into constant capital and variable capital into means of production and labourpower labourpower is the form under which variable capital exists during the process of production in this process the labourpower is itself consumed by the capitalist while the means of production are consumed by the labourpower in the exercise of its function labour at the same time the money paid for the purchase of the labourpower is converted into necessaries that are consumed not by “productive labour” but by the “productive labourer” adam smith by a fundamentally perverted analysis arrives at the absurd conclusion that even though each individual capital is divided into a constant and a variable part the capital of society resolves itself only into variable capital ie is laid out exclusively in payment of wages for instance suppose a cloth manufacturer converts £ into capital one portion he lays out in buying weavers the other in woollen yarn machinery c but the people from whom he buys the yarn and the machinery pay for labour with a part of the purchase money and so on until the whole £ are spent in the payment of wages ie until the entire product represented by the £ has been consumed by productive labourers it is evident that the whole gist of this argument lies in the words “and so on” which send us from pillar to post in truth adam smith breaks his investigation off just where its difficulties begin the annual process of reproduction is easily understood so long as we keep in view merely the sum total of the year’s production but every single component of this product must be brought into the market as a commodity and there the difficulty begins the movements of the individual capitals and of the personal revenues cross and intermingle and are lost in the general change of places in the circulation of the wealth of society this dazes the sight and propounds very complicated problems for solution in the third part of book ii i shall give the analysis of the real bearings of the facts it is one of the great merits of the physiocrats that in their tableau économique they were the first to attempt to depict the annual production in the shape in which it is presented to us after passing through the process of circulation for the rest it is a matter of course that political economy acting in the interests of the capitalist class has not failed to exploit the doctrine of adam smith viz that the whole of that part of the surplusproduct which is converted into capital is consumed by the working class section separation of surplusvalue into capital and revenue the abstinence theory in the last preceding chapter we treated surplusvalue or the surplusproduct solely as a fund for supplying the individual consumption of the capitalist in this chapter we have so far treated it solely as a fund for accumulation it is however neither the one nor the other but is both together one portion is consumed by the capitalist as revenue the other is employed as capital is accumulated given the mass of surplusvalue then the larger the one of these parts the smaller is the other caeteris paribus the ratio of these parts determines the magnitude of the accumulation but it is by the owner of the surplusvalue by the capitalist alone that the division is made it is his deliberate act that part of the tribute exacted by him which he accumulates is said to be saved by him because he does not eat it ie because he performs the function of a capitalist and enriches himself except as personified capital the capitalist has no historical value and no right to that historical existence which to use an expression of the witty lichnowsky “hasn’t got no date” and so far only is the necessity for his own transitory existence implied in the transitory necessity for the capitalist mode of production but so far as he is personified capital it is not values in use and the enjoyment of them but exchangevalue and its augmentation that spur him into action fanatically bent on making value expand itself he ruthlessly forces the human race to produce for production’s sake he thus forces the development of the productive powers of society and creates those material conditions which alone can form the real basis of a higher form of society a society in which the full and free development of every individual forms the ruling principle only as personified capital is the capitalist respectable as such he shares with the miser the passion for wealth as wealth but that which in the miser is a mere idiosyncrasy is in the capitalist the effect of the social mechanism of which he is but one of the wheels moreover the development of capitalist production makes it constantly necessary to keep increasing the amount of the capital laid out in a given industrial undertaking and competition makes the immanent laws of capitalist production to be felt by each individual capitalist as external coercive laws it compels him to keep constantly extending his capital in order to preserve it but extend it he cannot except by means of progressive accumulation so far therefore as his actions are a mere function of capital – endowed as capital is in his person with consciousness and a will – his own private consumption is a robbery perpetrated on accumulation just as in bookkeeping by double entry the private expenditure of the capitalist is placed on the debtor side of his account against his capital to accumulate is to conquer the world of social wealth to increase the mass of human beings exploited by him and thus to extend both the direct and the indirect sway of the capitalist but original sin is at work everywhere as capitalist production accumulation and wealth become developed the capitalist ceases to be the mere incarnation of capital he has a fellowfeeling for his own adam and his education gradually enables him to smile at the rage for asceticism as a mere prejudice of the oldfashioned miser while the capitalist of the classical type brands individual consumption as a sin against his function and as “abstinence” from accumulating the modernised capitalist is capable of looking upon accumulation as “abstinence” from pleasure “two souls alas do dwell with in his breast the one is ever parting from the other” at the historical dawn of capitalist production – and every capitalist upstart has personally to go through this historical stage – avarice and desire to get rich are the ruling passions but the progress of capitalist production not only creates a world of delights it lays open in speculation and the credit system a thousand sources of sudden enrichment when a certain stage of development has been reached a conventional degree of prodigality which is also an exhibition of wealth and consequently a source of credit becomes a business necessity to the “unfortunate” capitalist luxury enters into capital’s expenses of representation moreover the capitalist gets rich not like the miser in proportion to his personal labour and restricted consumption but at the same rate as he squeezes out the labourpower of others and enforces on the labourer abstinence from all life’s enjoyments although therefore the prodigality of the capitalist never possesses the bona fide character of the openhanded feudal lord’s prodigality but on the contrary has always lurking behind it the most sordid avarice and the most anxious calculation yet his expenditure grows with his accumulation without the one necessarily restricting the other but along with this growth there is at the same time developed in his breast a faustian conflict between the passion for accumulation and the desire for enjoyment dr aikin says in a work published in “the trade of manchester may be divided into four periods first when manufacturers were obliged to work hard for their livelihood” they enriched themselves chiefly by robbing the parents whose children were bound as apprentices to them the parents paid a high premium while the apprentices were starved on the other hand the average profits were low and to accumulate extreme parsimony was requisite they lived like misers and were far from consuming even the interest on their capital “the second period when they had begun to acquire little fortunes but worked as hard as before” – for direct exploitation of labour costs labour as every slavedriver knows – “and lived in as plain a manner as before the third when luxury began and the trade was pushed by sending out riders for orders into every market town in the kingdom it is probable that few or no capitals of £ to £ acquired by trade existed here before however about that time or a little later the traders had got money beforehand and began to build modern brick houses instead of those of wood and plaster” even in the early part of the th century a manchester manufacturer who placed a pint of foreign wine before his guests exposed himself to the remarks and headshakings of all his neighbours before the rise of machinery a manufacturer’s evening expenditure at the public house where they all met never exceeded sixpence for a glass of punch and a penny for a screw of tobacco it was not till and this marks an epoch that a person actually engaged in business was seen with an equipage of his own “the fourth period” the last years of the th century “is that in which expense and luxury have made great progress and was supported by a trade extended by means of riders and factors through every part of europe” what would the good dr aikin say if he could rise from his grave and see the manchester of today accumulate accumulate that is moses and the prophets “industry furnishes the material which saving accumulates” therefore save save ie reconvert the greatest possible portion of surplusvalue or surplusproduct into capital accumulation for accumulation’s sake production for production’s sake by this formula classical economy expressed the historical mission of the bourgeoisie and did not for a single instant deceive itself over the birththroes of wealth but what avails lamentation in the face of historical necessity if to classical economy the proletarian is but a machine for the production of surplusvalue on the other hand the capitalist is in its eyes only a machine for the conversion of this surplusvalue into additional capital political economy takes the historical function of the capitalist in bitter earnest in order to charm out of his bosom the awful conflict between the desire for enjoyment and the chase after riches malthus about the year advocated a division of labour which assigns to the capitalist actually engaged in production the business of accumulating and to the other sharers in surplusvalue to the landlords the placemen the beneficed clergy c the business of spending it is of the highest importance he says “to keep separate the passion for expenditure and the passion for accumulation” the capitalists having long been good livers and men of the world uttered loud cries what exclaimed one of their spokesmen a disciple of ricardo mr malthus preaches high rents heavy taxes c so that the pressure of the spur may constantly be kept on the industrious by unproductive consumers by all means production production on a constantly increasing scale runs the shibboleth but “production will by such a process be far more curbed in than spurred on nor is it quite fair thus to maintain in idleness a number of persons only to pinch others who are likely from their characters if you can force them to work to work with success” unfair as he finds it to spur on the industrial capitalist by depriving his bread of its butter yet he thinks it necessary to reduce the labourer’s wages to a minimum to keep him industrious” nor does he for a moment conceal the fact that the appropriation of unpaid labour is the secret of surplusvalue “increased demand on the part of the labourers means nothing more than their willingness to take less of their own product for themselves and leave a greater part of it to their employers and if it be said that this begets glut by lessening consumption” on the part of the labourers “i can only reply that glut is synonymous with large profits” the learned disputation how the booty pumped out of the labourer may be divided with most advantage to accumulation between the industrial capitalist and the rich idler was hushed in face of the revolution of july shortly afterwards the town proletariat at lyons sounded the tocsin of revolution and the country proletariat in england began to set fire to farmyards and cornstacks on this side of the channel owenism began to spread on the other side st simonism and fourierism the hour of vulgar economy had struck exactly a year before nassau w senior discovered at manchester that the profit including interest of capital is the product of the last hour of the twelve he had announced to the world another discovery “i substitute” he proudly says “for the word capital considered as an instrument of production the word abstinence” an unparalleled sample this of the discoveries of vulgar economy it substitutes for an economic category a sycophantic phrase – voilà tout that’s all “when the savage” says senior “makes bows he exercises an industry but he does not practise abstinence” this explains how and why in the earlier states of society the implements of labour were fabricated without abstinence on the part of the capitalist “the more society progresses the more abstinence is demanded” namely from those who ply the industry of appropriating the fruits of others’ industry all the conditions for carrying on the labour process are suddenly converted into so many acts of abstinence on the part of the capitalist if the corn is not all eaten but part of it also sown – abstinence of the capitalist if the wine gets time to mature – abstinence of the capitalist the capitalist robs his own self whenever he “lends the instruments of production to the labourer” that is whenever by incorporating labourpower with them he uses them to extract surplusvalue out of that labourpower instead of eating them up steamengines cotton railways manure horses and all or as the vulgar economist childishly puts it instead of dissipating “their value” in luxuries and other articles of consumption how the capitalists as a class are to perform that feat is a secret that vulgar economy has hitherto obstinately refused to divulge enough that the world still jogs on solely through the selfchastisement of this modern penitent of vishnu the capitalist not only accumulation but the simple “conservation of a capital requires a constant effort to resist the temptation of consuming it” the simple dictates of humanity therefore plainly enjoin the release of the capitalist from this martyrdom and temptation in the same way that the georgian slaveowner was lately delivered by the abolition of slavery from the painful dilemma whether to squander the surplusproduct lashed out of his niggers entirely in champagne or whether to reconvert a part of it into more niggers and more land in economic forms of society of the most different kinds there occurs not only simple reproduction but in varying degrees reproduction on a progressively increasing scale by degrees more is produced and more consumed and consequently more products have to be converted into means of production this process however does not present itself as accumulation of capital nor as the function of a capitalist so long as the labourer’s means of production and with them his product and means of subsistence do not confront him in the shape of capital richard jones who died a few years ago and was the successor of malthus in the chair of political economy at haileybury college discusses this point well in the light of two important facts since the great mass of the hindu population are peasants cultivating their land themselves their products their instruments of labour and means of subsistence never take “the shape of a fund saved from revenue which fund has therefore gone through a previous process of accumulation” on the other hand the nonagricultural labourers in those provinces where the english rule has least disturbed the old system are directly employed by the magnates to whom a portion of the agricultural surplusproduct is rendered in the shape of tribute or rent one portion of this product is consumed by the magnates in kind another is converted for their use by the labourers into articles of luxury and such like things while the rest forms the wages of the labourers who own their implements of labour here production and reproduction on a progressively increasing scale go on their way without any intervention from that queer saint that knight of the woeful countenance the capitalist “abstainer” section circumstances that independently of the proportional division of surplusvalue into capital and revenue determine the amount of accumulation degree of exploitation of labourpower productivity of labour growing difference in amount between capital employed and capital consumed magnitude of capital advanced the proportion in which surplusvalue breaks up into capital and revenue being given the magnitude of the capital accumulated clearly depends on the absolute magnitude of the surplusvalue suppose that per cent were capitalised and per cent eaten up the accumulated capital will be £ or £ according as the total surplusvalue has amounted to £ or £ hence all the circumstances that determine the mass of surplusvalue operate to determine the magnitude of the accumulation we sum them up once again but only in so far as they afford new points of view in regard to accumulation it will be remembered that the rate of surplusvalue depends in the first place on the degree of exploitation of labourpower political economy values this fact so highly that it occasionally identifies the acceleration of accumulation due to increased productiveness of labour with its acceleration due to increased exploitation of the labourer in the chapters on the production of surplusvalue it was constantly presupposed that wages are at least equal to the value of labourpower forcible reduction of wages below this value plays however in practice too important a part for us not to pause upon it for a moment it in fact transforms within certain limits the labourer’s necessary consumption fund into a fund for the accumulation of capital “wages” says john stuart mill “have no productive power they are the price of a productive power wages do not contribute along with labour to the production of commodities no more than the price of tools contributes along with the tools themselves if labour could be had without purchase wages might be dispensed with” but if the labourers could live on air they could not be bought at any price the zero of their cost is therefore a limit in a mathematical sense always beyond reach although we can always approximate more and more nearly to it the constant tendency of capital is to force the cost of labour back towards this zero a writer of the th century often quoted already the author of the “essay on trade and commerce” only betrays the innermost secret soul of english capitalism when he declares the historic mission of england to be the forcing down of english wages to the level of the french and the dutch with other things he says naively “but if our poor” technical term for labourers “will live luxuriously then labour must of course be dear when it is considered what luxuries the manufacturing populace consume such as brandy gin tea sugar foreign fruit strong beer printed linens snuff tobacco c” he quotes the work of a northamptonshire manufacturer who with eyes squinting heavenward moans “labour is onethird cheaper in france than in england for their poor work hard and fare hard as to their food and clothing their chief diet is bread fruit herbs roots and dried fish for they very seldom eat flesh and when wheat is dear they eat very little bread” “to which may be added” our essayist goes on “that their drink is either water or other small liquors so that they spend very little money these things are very difficult to be brought about but they are not impracticable since they have been effected both in france and in holland” twenty years later an american humbug the baronised yankee benjamin thompson alias count rumford followed the same line of philanthropy to the great satisfaction of god and man his “essays” are a cookery book with receipts of all kinds for replacing by some succedaneum the ordinary dear food of the labourer the following is a particularly successful receipt of this wonderful philosopher “ lbs of barleymeal ½d lbs of indian corn ¼d d worth of red herring d salt d vinegar d pepper and sweet herbs in all ¾ make a soup for men and at the medium price of barley and of indian corn this soup may be provided at ¼d the portion of ounces” with the advance of capitalistic production the adulteration of food rendered thompson’s ideal superfluous at the end of the th and during the first ten years of the th century the english farmers and landlords enforced the absolute minimum of wage by paying the agricultural labourers less than the minimum in the form of wages and the remainder in the shape of parochial relief an example of the waggish way in which the english dogberries acted in their “legal” fixing of a wages tariff “the squires of norfolk had dined says mr burke when they fixed the rate of wages the squires of berks evidently thought the labourers ought not to do so when they fixed the rate of wages at speenhamland there they decide that ‘income weekly should be s for a man’ when the gallon or halfpeck loaf of lbs oz is at s and increase regularly till bread is s d when it is above that sum decrease regularly till it be at s and then his food should be th less” before the committee of inquiry of the house of lords a certain a bennett a large farmer magistrate poorlaw guardian and wageregulator was asked “has any proportion of the value of daily labour been made up to the labourers out of the poors’ rate” answer “yes it has the weekly income of every family is made up to the gallon loaf lbs oz and d per head the gallon loaf per week is what we suppose sufficient for the maintenance of every person in the family for the week and the d is for clothes and if the parish think proper to find clothes the d is deducted this practice goes through all the western part of wiltshire and i believe throughout the country” “for years” exclaims a bourgeois author of that time “they the farmers have degraded a respectable class of their countrymen by forcing them to have recourse to the workhouse the farmer while increasing his own gains has prevented any accumulation on the part of his labouring dependents” the part played in our days by the direct robbery from the labourer’s necessary consumption fund in the formation of surplusvalue and therefore of the accumulation fund of capital the socalled domestic industry has served to show ch xv sect c further facts on this subject will be given later although in all branches of industry that part of the constant capital consisting of instruments of labour must be sufficient for a certain number of labourers determined by the magnitude of the undertaking it by no means always necessarily increases in the same proportion as the quantity of labour employed in a factory suppose that labourers working hours a day yield workinghours if the capitalist wishes to raise this sum by one half he can employ more workers but then he must also advance more capital not merely for wages but for instruments of labour but he might also let the labourers work hours instead of and then the instruments of labour already to hand would be enough these would then simply be more rapidly consumed thus additional labour begotten of the greater tension of labourpower can augment surplusproduct and surplusvalue ie the subjectmatter of accumulation without corresponding augmentation in the constant part of capital in the extractive industries mines c the raw materials form no part of the capital advanced the subject of labour is in this case not a product of previous labour but is furnished by nature gratis as in the case of metals minerals coal stone c in these cases the constant capital consists almost exclusively of instruments of labour which can very well absorb an increased quantity of labour day and night shifts of labourers eg all other things being equal the mass and value of the product will rise in direct proportion to the labour expended as on the first day of production the original produceformers now turned into the creators of the material elements of capital – man and nature – still work together thanks to the elasticity of labourpower the domain of accumulation has extended without any previous enlargement of constant capital in agriculture the land under cultivation cannot be increased without the advance of more seed and manure but this advance once made the purely mechanical working of the soil itself produces a marvellous effect on the amount of the product a greater quantity of labour done by the same number of labourers as before thus increases the fertility without requiring any new advance in the instruments of labour it is once again the direct action of man on nature which becomes an immediate source of greater accumulation without the intervention of any new capital finally in what is called manufacturing industry every additional expenditure of labour presupposes a corresponding additional expenditure of raw materials but not necessarily of instruments of labour and as extractive industry and agriculture supply manufacturing industry with its raw materials and those of its instruments of labour the additional product the former have created without additional advance of capital tells also in favour of the latter general result by incorporating with itself the two primary creators of wealth labourpower and the land capital acquires a power of expansion that permits it to augment the elements of its accumulation beyond the limits apparently fixed by its own magnitude or by the value and the mass of the means of production already produced in which it has its being another important factor in the accumulation of capital is the degree of productivity of social labour with the productive power of labour increases the mass of the products in which a certain value and therefore a surplusvalue of a given magnitude is embodied the rate of surplusvalue remaining the same or even falling so long as it only falls more slowly than the productive power of labour rises the mass of the surplusproduct increases the division of this product into revenue and additional capital remaining the same the consumption of the capitalist may therefore increase without any decrease in the fund of accumulation the relative magnitude of the accumulation fund may even increase at the expense of the consumption fund whilst the cheapening of commodities places at the disposal of the capitalist as many means of enjoyment as formerly or even more than formerly but handinhand with the increasing productivity of labour goes as we have seen the cheapening of the labourer therefore a higher rate of surplusvalue even when the real wages are rising the latter never rise proportionally to the productive power of labour the same value in variable capital therefore sets in movement more labourpower and therefore more labour the same value in constant capital is embodied in more means of production ie in more instruments of labour materials of labour and auxiliary materials it therefore also supplies more elements for the production both of use value and of value and with these more absorbers of labour the value of the additional capital therefore remaining the same or even diminishing accelerated accumulation still takes place not only does the scale of reproduction materially extend but the production of surplusvalue increases more rapidly than the value of the additional capital the development of the productive power of labour reacts also on the original capital already engaged in the process of production a part of the functioning constant capital consists of instruments of labour such as machinery c which are not consumed and therefore not reproduced or replaced by new ones of the same kind until after long periods of time but every year a part of these instruments of labour perishes or reaches the limit of its productive function it reaches therefore in that year the time for its periodical reproduction for its replacement by new ones of the same kind if the productiveness of labour has during the using up of these instruments of labour increased and it develops continually with the uninterrupted advance of science and technology more efficient and considering their increased efficiency cheaper machines tools apparatus c replace the old the old capital is reproduced in a more productive form apart from the constant detail improvements in the instruments of labour already in use the other part of the constant capital raw material and auxiliary substances is constantly reproduced in less than a year those produced by agriculture for the most part annually every introduction of improved methods therefore works almost simultaneously on the new capital and on that already in action every advance in chemistry not only multiplies the number of useful materials and the useful applications of those already known thus extending with the growth of capital its sphere of investment it teaches at the same time how to throw the excrements of the processes of production and consumption back again into the circle of the process of reproduction and thus without any previous outlay of capital creates new matter for capital like the increased exploitation of natural wealth by the mere increase in the tension of labourpower science and technology give capital a power of expansion independent of the given magnitude of the capital actually functioning they react at the same time on that part of the original capital which has entered upon its stage of renewal this in passing into its new shape incorporates gratis the social advance made while its old shape was being used up of course this development of productive power is accompanied by a partial depreciation of functioning capital so far as this depreciation makes itself acutely felt in competition the burden falls on the labourer in the increased exploitation of whom the capitalist looks for his indemnification labour transmits to its product the value of the means of production consumed by it on the other hand the value and mass of the means of production set in motion by a given quantity of labour increase as the labour becomes more productive though the same quantity of labour adds always to its products only the same sum of new value still the old capital value transmitted by the labour to the products increases with the growing productivity of labour an english and a chinese spinner eg may work the same number of hours with the same intensity then they will both in a week create equal values but in spite of this equality an immense difference will obtain between the value of the week’s product of the englishman who works with a mighty automaton and that of the chinaman who has but a spinningwheel in the same time as the chinaman spins one pound of cotton the englishman spins several hundreds of pounds a sum many hundred times as great of old values swells the value of his product in which those reappear in a new useful form and can thus function anew as capital “in ” as frederick engels teaches us “all the wool crop in england of the three preceding years lay untouched for want of labourers and so it must have lain if newly invented machinery had not come to its aid and spun it” labour embodied in the form of machinery of course did not directly force into life a single man but it made it possible for a smaller number of labourers with the addition of relatively less living labour not only to consume the wool productively and put into it new value but to preserve in the form of yarn c its old value at the same time it caused and stimulated increased reproduction of wool it is the natural property of living labour to transmit old value whilst it creates new hence with the increase in efficacy extent and value of its means of production consequently with the accumulation that accompanies the development of its productive power labour keeps up and eternises an always increasing capital value in a form ever new” this natural power of labour takes the appearance of an intrinsic property of capital in which it is incorporated just as the productive forces of social labour take the appearance of inherent properties of capital and as the constant appropriation of surplus labour by the capitalists takes that of a constant selfexpansion of capital with the increase of capital the difference between the capital employed and the capital consumed increases in other words there is increase in the value and the material mass of the instruments of labour such as buildings machinery drainpipes workingcattle apparatus of every kind that function for a longer or shorter time in processes of production constantly repeated or that serve for the attainment of particular useful effects whilst they themselves only gradually wear out therefore only lose their value piecemeal therefore transfer that value to the product only bit by bit in the same proportion as these instruments of labour serve as productformers without adding value to the product ie in the same proportion as they are wholly employed but only partly consumed they perform as we saw earlier the same gratuitous service as the natural forces water steam air electricity etc this gratuitous service of past labour when seized and filled with a soul by living labour increases with the advancing stages of accumulation since past labour always disguises itself as capital ie since the passive of the labour of a b c etc takes the form of the active of the nonlabourer x bourgeois and political economists are full of praises of the services of dead and gone labour which according to the scotch genius macculloch ought to receive a special remuneration in the shape of interest profit etc the powerful and everincreasing assistance given by past labour to the living labour process under the form of means of production is therefore attributed to that form of past labour in which it is alienated as unpaid labour from the worker himself ie to its capitalistic form the practical agents of capitalistic production and their pettifogging ideologists are as unable to think of the means of production as separate from the antagonistic social mask they wear today as a slaveowner to think of the worker himself as distinct from his character as a slave with a given degree of exploitation of labourpower the mass of the surplusvalue produced is determined by the number of workers simultaneously exploited and this corresponds although in varying proportions with the magnitude of the capital the more therefore capital increases by means of successive accumulations the more does the sum of the value increase that is divided into consumption fund and accumulation fund the capitalist can therefore live a more jolly life and at the same time show more “abstinence” and finally all the springs of production act with greater elasticity the more its scale extends with the mass of the capital advanced section the socalled labour fund it has been shown in the course of this inquiry that capital is not a fixed magnitude but is a part of social wealth elastic and constantly fluctuating with the division of fresh surplusvalue into revenue and additional capital it has been seen further that even with a given magnitude of functioning capital the labourpower the science and the land by which are to be understood economically all conditions of labour furnished by nature independently of man embodied in it form elastic powers of capital allowing it within certain limits a field of action independent of its own magnitude in this inquiry we have neglected all effects of the process of circulation effects which may produce very different degrees of efficiency in the same mass of capital and as we presupposed the limits set by capitalist production that is to say presupposed the process of social production in a form developed by purely spontaneous growth we neglected any more rational combination directly and systematically practicable with the means of production and the mass of labourpower at present disposable classical economy always loved to conceive social capital as a fixed magnitude of a fixed degree of efficiency but this prejudice was first established as a dogma by the archphilistine jeremy bentham that insipid pedantic leathertongued oracle of the ordinary bourgeois intelligence of the th century bentham is among philosophers what martin tupper is among poets both could only have been manufactured in england in the light of his dogma the commonest phenomena of the process of production as eg its sudden expansions and contractions nay even accumulation itself become perfectly inconceivable the dogma was used by bentham himself as well as by malthus james mill macculloch etc for an apologetic purpose and especially in order to represent one part of capital namely variable capital or that part convertible into labourpower as a fixed magnitude the material of variable capital ie the mass of the means of subsistence it represents for the labourer or the socalled labour fund was fabled as a separate part of social wealth fixed by natural laws and unchangeable to set in motion the part of social wealth which is to function as constant capital or to express it in a material form as means of production a definite mass of living labour is required this mass is given technologically but neither is the number of labourers required to render fluid this mass of labourpower given it changes with the degree of exploitation of the individual labourpower nor is the price of this labourpower given but only its minimum limit which is moreover very variable the facts that lie at the bottom of this dogma are these on the one hand the labourer has no right to interfere in the division of social wealth into means of enjoyment for the nonlabourer and means of production on the other hand only in favourable and exceptional cases has he the power to enlarge the socalled labour fund at the expense of the “revenue” of the wealthy what silly tautology results from the attempt to represent the capitalistic limits of the labour fund as its natural and social limits may be seen eg in professor fawcett “the circulating capital of a country” he says “is its wagefund hence if we desire to calculate the average money wages received by each labourer we have simply to divide the amount of this capital by the number of the labouring population” that is to say we first add together the individual wages actually paid and then we affirm that the sum thus obtained forms the total value of the “labour fund” determined and vouchsafed to us by god and nature lastly we divide the sum thus obtained by the number of labourers to find out again how much may come to each on the average an uncommonly knowing dodge this it did not prevent mr fawcett saying in the same breath “the aggregate wealth which is annually saved in england is divided into two portions one portion is employed as capital to maintain our industry and the other portion is exported to foreign countries only a portion and perhaps not a large portion of the wealth which is annually saved in this country is invested in our own industry the greater part of the yearly accruing surplusproduct embezzled because abstracted without return of an equivalent from the english labourer is thus used as capital not in england but in foreign countries but with the additional capital thus exported a part of the “labour fund” invented by god and bentham is also exported chapter the general law of capitalist accumulation section the increased demand for labour power that accompanies accumulation the composition of capital remaining the same in this chapter we consider the influence of the growth of capital on the lot of the labouring class the most important factor in this inquiry is the composition of capital and the changes it undergoes in the course of the process of accumulation the composition of capital is to be understood in a twofold sense on the side of value it is determined by the proportion in which it is divided into constant capital or value of the means of production and variable capital or value of labour power the sum total of wages on the side of material as it functions in the process of production all capital is divided into means of production and living labour power this latter composition is determined by the relation between the mass of the means of production employed on the one hand and the mass of labour necessary for their employment on the other i call the former the valuecomposition the latter the technical composition of capital between the two there is a strict correlation to express this i call the value composition of capital in so far as it is determined by its technical composition and mirrors the changes of the latter the organic composition of capital wherever i refer to the composition of capital without further qualification its organic composition is always understood the many individual capitals invested in a particular branch of production have one with another more or less different compositions the average of their individual compositions gives us the composition of the total capital in this branch of production lastly the average of these averages in all branches of production gives us the composition of the total social capital of a country and with this alone are we in the last resort concerned in the following investigation growth of capital involves growth of its variable constituent or of the part invested in labour power a part of the surplusvalue turned into additional capital must always be retransformed into variable capital or additional labour fund if we suppose that all other circumstances remaining the same the composition of capital also remains constant ie that a definite mass of means of production constantly needs the same mass of labour power to set it in motion then the demand for labour and the subsistencefund of the labourers clearly increase in the same proportion as the capital and the more rapidly the more rapidly the capital increases since the capital produces yearly a surplusvalue of which one part is yearly added to the original capital since this increment itself grows yearly along with the augmentation of the capital already functioning since lastly under special stimulus to enrichment such as the opening of new markets or of new spheres for the outlay of capital in consequence of newly developed social wants c the scale of accumulation may be suddenly extended merely by a change in the division of the surplusvalue or surplusproduct into capital and revenue the requirements of accumulating capital may exceed the increase of labour power or of the number of labourers the demand for labourers may exceed the supply and therefore wages may rise this must indeed ultimately be the case if the conditions supposed above continue for since in each year more labourers are employed than in its predecessor sooner or later a point must be reached at which the requirements of accumulation begin to surpass the customary supply of labour and therefore a rise of wages takes place a lamentation on this score was heard in england during the whole of the fifteenth and the first half of the eighteenth centuries the more or less favourable circumstances in which the wage working class supports and multiplies itself in no way alter the fundamental character of capitalist production as simple reproduction constantly reproduces the capital relation itself ie the relation of capitalists on the one hand and wage workers on the other so reproduction on a progressive scale ie accumulation reproduces the capital relation on a progressive scale more capitalists or larger capitalists at this pole more wage workers at that the reproduction of a mass of labour power which must incessantly reincorporate itself with capital for that capital’s selfexpansion which cannot get free from capital and whose enslavement to capital is only concealed by the variety of individual capitalists to whom it sells itself this reproduction of labour power forms in fact an essential of the reproduction of capital itself accumulation of capital is therefore increase of the proletariat classical economy grasped this fact so thoroughly that adam smith ricardo c as mentioned earlier inaccurately identified accumulation with the consumption by the productive labourers of all the capitalised part of the surplusproduct or with its transformation into additional wage labourers as early as john bellers says “for if one had a hundred thousand acres of land and as many pounds in money and as many cattle without a labourer what would the rich man be but a labourer and as the labourers make men rich so the more labourers there will be the more rich men the labour of the poor being the mines of the rich” so also bernard de mandeville at the beginning of the eighteenth century “it would be easier where property is well secured to live without money than without poor for who would do the work as they the poor ought to be kept from starving so they should receive nothing worth saving if here and there one of the lowest class by uncommon industry and pinching his belly lifts himself above the condition he was brought up in nobody ought to hinder him nay it is undeniably the wisest course for every person in the society and for every private family to be frugal but it is the interest of all rich nations that the greatest part of the poor should almost never be idle and yet continually spend what they get those that get their living by their daily labour have nothing to stir them up to be serviceable but their wants which it is prudence to relieve but folly to cure the only thing then that can render the labouring man industrious is a moderate quantity of money for as too little will according as his temper is either dispirit or make him desperate so too much will make him insolent and lazy from what has been said it is manifest that in a free nation where slaves are not allowed of the surest wealth consists in a multitude of laborious poor for besides that they are the neverfailing nursery of fleets and armies without them there could be no enjoyment and no product of any country could be valuable “to make the society” which of course consists of nonworkers “happy and people easier under the meanest circumstances it is requisite that great numbers of them should be ignorant as well as poor knowledge both enlarges and multiplies our desires and the fewer things a man wishes for the more easily his necessities may be supplied” what mandeville an honest clearheaded man had not yet seen is that the mechanism of the process of accumulation itself increases along with the capital the mass of “labouring poor” ie the wage labourers who turn their labour power into an increasing power of selfexpansion of the growing capital and even by doing so must eternise their dependent relation on their own product as personified in the capitalists in reference to this relation of dependence sir f m eden in his “the state of the poor an history of the labouring classes in england” says “the natural produce of our soil is certainly not fully adequate to our subsistence we can neither be clothed lodged nor fed but in consequence of some previous labour a portion at least of the society must be indefatigably employed there are others who though they ‘neither toil nor spin’ can yet command the produce of industry but who owe their exemption from labour solely to civilisation and order they are peculiarly the creatures of civil institutions which have recognised that individuals may acquire property by various other means besides the exertion of labour persons of independent fortune owe their superior advantages by no means to any superior abilities of their own but almost entirely to the industry of others it is not the possession of land or of money but the command of labour which distinguishes the opulent from the labouring part of the community this scheme approved by eden would give the people of property sufficient but by no means too much influence and authority over those who work for them and it would place such labourers not in an abject or servile condition but in such a state of easy and liberal dependence as all who know human nature and its history will allow to be necessary for their own comfort” sir f m eden it may be remarked in passing is the only disciple of adam smith during the eighteenth century that produced any work of importance under the conditions of accumulation supposed thus far which conditions are those most favourable to the labourers their relation of dependence upon capital takes on a form endurable or as eden says “easy and liberal” instead of becoming more intensive with the growth of capital this relation of dependence only becomes more extensive ie the sphere of capital’s exploitation and rule merely extends with its own dimensions and the number of its subjects a larger part of their own surplusproduct always increasing and continually transformed into additional capital comes back to them in the shape of means of payment so that they can extend the circle of their enjoyments can make some additions to their consumptionfund of clothes furniture c and can lay by small reserve funds of money but just as little as better clothing food and treatment and a larger peculium do away with the exploitation of the slave so little do they set aside that of the wage worker a rise in the price of labour as a consequence of accumulation of capital only means in fact that the length and weight of the golden chain the wage worker has already forged for himself allow of a relaxation of the tension of it in the controversies on this subject the chief fact has generally been overlooked viz the differentia specifica defining characteristic of capitalistic production labour power is sold today not with a view of satisfying by its service or by its product the personal needs of the buyer his aim is augmentation of his capital production of commodities containing more labour than he pays for containing therefore a portion of value that costs him nothing and that is nevertheless realised when the commodities are sold production of surplusvalue is the absolute law of this mode of production labourpower is only saleable so far as it preserves the means of production in their capacity of capital reproduces its own value as capital and yields in unpaid labour a source of additional capital the conditions of its sale whether more or less favourable to the labourer include therefore the necessity of its constant reselling and the constantly extended reproduction of all wealth in the shape of capital wages as we have seen by their very nature always imply the performance of a certain quantity of unpaid labour on the part of the labourer altogether irrespective of the case of a rise of wages with a falling price of labour c such an increase only means at best a quantitative diminution of the unpaid labour that the worker has to supply this diminution can never reach the point at which it would threaten the system itself apart from violent conflicts as to the rate of wages and adam smith has already shown that in such a conflict taken on the whole the master is always master a rise in the price of labour resulting from accumulation of capital implies the following alternative either the price of labour keeps on rising because its rise does not interfere with the progress of accumulation in this there is nothing wonderful for says adam smith “after these profits are diminished stock may not only continue to increase but to increase much faster than before a great stock though with small profits generally increases faster than a small stock with great profits” l c ii p in this case it is evident that a diminution in the unpaid labour in no way interferes with the extension of the domain of capital – or on the other hand accumulation slackens in consequence of the rise in the price of labour because the stimulus of gain is blunted the rate of accumulation lessens but with its lessening the primary cause of that lessening vanishes ie the disproportion between capital and exploitable labour power the mechanism of the process of capitalist production removes the very obstacles that it temporarily creates the price of labour falls again to a level corresponding with the needs of the selfexpansion of capital whether the level be below the same as or above the one which was normal before the rise of wages took place we see thus in the first case it is not the diminished rate either of the absolute or of the proportional increase in labour power or labouring population which causes capital to be in excess but conversely the excess of capital that makes exploitable labour power insufficient in the second case it is not the increased rate either of the absolute or of the proportional increase in labour power or labouring population that makes capital insufficient but conversely the relative diminution of capital that causes the exploitable labour power or rather its price to be in excess it is these absolute movements of the accumulation of capital which are reflected as relative movements of the mass of exploitable labour power and therefore seem produced by the latter’s own independent movement to put it mathematically the rate of accumulation is the independent not the dependent variable the rate of wages the dependent not the independent variable thus when the industrial cycle is in the phase of crisis a general fall in the price of commodities is expressed as a rise in the value of money and in the phase of prosperity a general rise in the price of commodities as a fall in the value of money the socalled currency school concludes from this that with high prices too much with low prices too little money is in circulation their ignorance and complete misunderstanding of facts are worthily paralleled by the economists who interpret the above phenomena of accumulation by saying that there are now too few now too many wage labourers the law of capitalist production that is at the bottom of the pretended “natural law of population” reduces itself simply to this the correlation between accumulation of capital and rate of wages is nothing else than the correlation between the unpaid labour transformed into capital and the additional paid labour necessary for the setting in motion of this additional capital it is therefore in no way a relation between two magnitudes independent one of the other on the one hand the magnitude of the capital on the other the number of the labouring population it is rather at bottom only the relation between the unpaid and the paid labour of the same labouring population if the quantity of unpaid labour supplied by the working class and accumulated by the capitalist class increases so rapidly that its conversion into capital requires an extraordinary addition of paid labour then wages rise and all other circumstances remaining equal the unpaid labour diminishes in proportion but as soon as this diminution touches the point at which the surplus labour that nourishes capital is no longer supplied in normal quantity a reaction sets in a smaller part of revenue is capitalised accumulation lags and the movement of rise in wages receives a check the rise of wages therefore is confined within limits that not only leave intact the foundations of the capitalistic system but also secure its reproduction on a progressive scale the law of capitalistic accumulation metamorphosed by economists into pretended law of nature in reality merely states that the very nature of accumulation excludes every diminution in the degree of exploitation of labour and every rise in the price of labour which could seriously imperil the continual reproduction on an everenlarging scale of the capitalistic relation it cannot be otherwise in a mode of production in which the labourer exists to satisfy the needs of selfexpansion of existing values instead of on the contrary material wealth existing to satisfy the needs of development on the part of the labourer as in religion man is governed by the products of his own brain so in capitalistic production he is governed by the products of his own hand section relative diminution of the variable part of capital simultaneously with the progress of accumulation and of the concentration that accompanies it according to the economists themselves it is neither the actual extent of social wealth nor the magnitude of the capital already functioning that lead to a rise of wages but only the constant growth of accumulation and the degree of rapidity of that growth adam smith book i chapter so far we have only considered one special phase of this process that in which the increase of capital occurs along with a constant technical composition of capital but the process goes beyond this phase once given the general basis of the capitalistic system then in the course of accumulation a point is reached at which the development of the productivity of social labour becomes the most powerful lever of accumulation “the same cause” says adam smith “which raises the wages of labour the increase of stock tends to increase its productive powers and to make a smaller quantity of labour produce a greater quantity of work” apart from natural conditions such as fertility of the soil c and from the skill of independent and isolated producers shown rather qualitatively in the goodness than quantitatively in the mass of their products the degree of productivity of labour in a given society is expressed in the relative extent of the means of production that one labourer during a given time with the same tension of labour power turns into products the mass of the means of production which he thus transforms increases with the productiveness of his labour but those means of production play a double part the increase of some is a consequence that of the others a condition of the increasing productivity of labour eg with the division of labour in manufacture and with the use of machinery more raw material is worked up in the same time and therefore a greater mass of raw material and auxiliary substances enter into the labour process that is the consequence of the increasing productivity of labour on the other hand the mass of machinery beasts of burden mineral manures drainpipes c is a condition of the increasing productivity of labour so also is it with the means of production concentrated in buildings furnaces means of transport c but whether condition or consequence the growing extent of the means of production as compared with the labour power incorporated with them is an expression of the growing productiveness of labour the increase of the latter appears therefore in the diminution of the mass of labour in proportion to the mass of means of production moved by it or in the diminution of the subjective factor of the labour process as compared with the objective factor this change in the technical composition of capital this growth in the mass of means of production as compared with the mass of the labour power that vivifies them is reflected again in its value composition by the increase of the constant constituent of capital at the expense of its variable constituent there may be eg originally per cent of a capital laid out in means of production and per cent in labour power later on with the development of the productivity of labour per cent in means of production per cent in labour power and so on this law of the progressive increase in constant capital in proportion to the variable is confirmed at every step as already shown by the comparative analysis of the prices of commodities whether we compare different economic epochs or different nations in the same epoch the relative magnitude of the element of price which represents the value of the means of production only or the constant part of capital consumed is in direct the relative magnitude of the other element of price that pays labour the variable part of capital is in inverse proportion to the advance of accumulation this diminution in the variable part of capital as compared with the constant or the altered valuecomposition of the capital however only shows approximately the change in the composition of its material constituents if eg the capitalvalue employed today in spinning is constant and variable whilst at the beginning of the th century it was ½ constant and ½ variable on the other hand the mass of raw material instruments of labour c that a certain quantity of spinning labour consumes productively today is many hundred times greater than at the beginning of the th century the reason is simply that with the increasing productivity of labour not only does the mass of the means of production consumed by it increase but their value compared with their mass diminishes their value therefore rises absolutely but not in proportion to their mass the increase of the difference between constant and variable capital is therefore much less than that of the difference between the mass of the means of production into which the constant and the mass of the labour power into which the variable capital is converted the former difference increases with the latter but in a smaller degree but if the progress of accumulation lessens the relative magnitude of the variable part of capital it by no means in doing this excludes the possibility of a rise in its absolute magnitude suppose that a capitalvalue at first is divided into per cent of constant and per cent of variable capital later into per cent of constant and per cent of variable if in the meantime the original capital say £ has increased to £ its variable constituent has also increased it was £ it is now £ but where as formerly an increase of capital by per cent would have sufficed to raise the demand for labour per cent now this latter rise requires a tripling of the original capital in part iv it was shown how the development of the productiveness of social labour presupposes cooperation on a large scale how it is only upon this supposition that division and combination of labour can be organised and the means of production economised by concentration on a vast scale how instruments of labour which from their very nature are only fit for use in common such as a system of machinery can be called into being how huge natural forces can be pressed into the service of production and how the transformation can be effected of the process of production into a technological application of science on the basis of the production of commodities where the means of production are the property of private persons and where the artisan therefore either produces commodities isolated from and independent of others or sells his labour power as a commodity because he lacks the means for independent industry cooperation on a large scale can realise itself only in the increase of individual capitals only in proportion as the means of social production and the means of subsistence are transformed into the private property of capitalists the basis of the production of commodities can admit of production on a large scale in the capitalistic form alone a certain accumulation of capital in the hands of individual producers of commodities forms therefore the necessary preliminary of the specifically capitalistic mode of production we had therefore to assume that this occurs during the transition from handicraft to capitalistic industry it may be called primitive accumulation because it is the historic basis instead of the historic result of specifically capitalist production how it itself originates we need not here inquire as yet it is enough that it forms the starting point but all methods for raising the social productive power of labour that are developed on this basis are at the same time methods for the increased production of surplusvalue or surplusproduct which in its turn is the formative element of accumulation they are therefore at the same time methods of the production of capital by capital or methods of its accelerated accumulation the continual retransformation of surplusvalue into capital now appears in the shape of the increasing magnitude of the capital that enters into the process of production this in turn is the basis of an extended scale of production of the methods for raising the productive power of labour that accompany it and of accelerated production of surplusvalue if therefore a certain degree of accumulation of capital appears as a condition of the specifically capitalist mode of production the latter causes conversely an accelerated accumulation of capital with the accumulation of capital therefore the specifically capitalistic mode of production develops and with the capitalist mode of production the accumulation of capital both these economic factors bring about in the compound ratio of the impulses they reciprocally give one another that change in the technical composition of capital by which the variable constituent becomes always smaller and smaller as compared with the constant every individual capital is a larger or smaller concentration of means of production with a corresponding command over a larger or smaller labourarmy every accumulation becomes the means of new accumulation with the increasing mass of wealth which functions as capital accumulation increases the concentration of that wealth in the hands of individual capitalists and thereby widens the basis of production on a large scale and of the specific methods of capitalist production the growth of social capital is effected by the growth of many individual capitals all other circumstances remaining the same individual capitals and with them the concentration of the means of production increase in such proportion as they form aliquot parts of the total social capital at the same time portions of the original capitals disengage themselves and function as new independent capitals besides other causes the division of property within capitalist families plays a great part in this with the accumulation of capital therefore the number of capitalists grows to a greater or less extent two points characterise this kind of concentration which grows directly out of or rather is identical with accumulation first the increasing concentration of the social means of production in the hands of individual capitalists is other things remaining equal limited by the degree of increase of social wealth second the part of social capital domiciled in each particular sphere of production is divided among many capitalists who face one another as independent commodityproducers competing with each other accumulation and the concentration accompanying it are therefore not only scattered over many points but the increase of each functioning capital is thwarted by the formation of new and the subdivision of old capitals accumulation therefore presents itself on the one hand as increasing concentration of the means of production and of the command over labour on the other as repulsion of many individual capitals one from another this splittingup of the total social capital into many individual capitals or the repulsion of its fractions one from another is counteracted by their attraction this last does not mean that simple concentration of the means of production and of the command over labour which is identical with accumulation it is concentration of capitals already formed destruction of their individual independence expropriation of capitalist by capitalist transformation of many small into few large capitals this process differs from the former in this that it only presupposes a change in the distribution of capital already to hand and functioning its field of action is therefore not limited by the absolute growth of social wealth by the absolute limits of accumulation capital grows in one place to a huge mass in a single hand because it has in another place been lost by many this is centralisation proper as distinct from accumulation and concentration the laws of this centralisation of capitals or of the attraction of capital by capital cannot be developed here a brief hint at a few facts must suffice the battle of competition is fought by cheapening of commodities the cheapness of commodities demands caeteris paribus on the productiveness of labour and this again on the scale of production therefore the larger capitals beat the smaller it will further be remembered that with the development of the capitalist mode of production there is an increase in the minimum amount of individual capital necessary to carry on a business under its normal conditions the smaller capitals therefore crowd into spheres of production which modern industry has only sporadically or incompletely got hold of here competition rages in direct proportion to the number and in inverse proportion to the magnitudes of the antagonistic capitals it always ends in the ruin of many small capitalists whose capitals partly pass into the hands of their conquerors partly vanish apart from this with capitalist production an altogether new force comes into play – the credit system which in its first stages furtively creeps in as the humble assistant of accumulation drawing into the hands of individual or associated capitalists by invisible threads the money resources which lie scattered over the surface of society in larger or smaller amounts but it soon becomes a new and terrible weapon in the battle of competition and is finally transformed into an enormous social mechanism for the centralisation of capitals commensurately with the development of capitalist production and accumulation there develop the two most powerful levers of centralisation – competition and credit at the same time the progress of accumulation increases the material amenable to centralisation ie the individual capitals whilst the expansion of capitalist production creates on the one hand the social want and on the other the technical means necessary for those immense industrial undertakings which require a previous centralisation of capital for their accomplishment today therefore the force of attraction drawing together individual capitals and the tendency to centralisation are stronger than ever before but if the relative extension and energy of the movement towards centralisation is determined in a certain degree by the magnitude of capitalist wealth and superiority of economic mechanism already attained progress in centralisation does not in any way depend upon a positive growth in the magnitude of social capital and this is the specific difference between centralisation and concentration the latter being only another name for reproduction on an extended scale centralisation may result from a mere change in the distribution of capitals already existing from a simple alteration in the quantitative grouping of the component parts of social capital here capital can grow into powerful masses in a single hand because there it has been withdrawn from many individual hands in any given branch of industry centralisation would reach its extreme limit if all the individual capitals invested in it were fused into a single capital in a given society the limit would be reached only when the entire social capital was united in the hands of either a single capitalist or a single capitalist company centralisation completes the work of accumulation by enabling industrial capitalists to extend the scale of their operations whether this latter result is the consequence of accumulation or centralisation whether centralisation is accomplished by the violent method of annexation – when certain capitals become such preponderant centres of attraction for others that they shatter the individual cohesion of the latter and then draw the separate fragments to themselves – or whether the fusion of a number of capitals already formed or in process of formation takes place by the smoother process of organising jointstock companies – the economic effect remains the same everywhere the increased scale of industrial establishments is the starting point for a more comprehensive organisation of the collective work of many for a wider development of their material motive forces – in other words for the progressive transformation of isolated processes of production carried on by customary methods into processes of production socially combined and scientifically arranged but accumulation the gradual increase of capital by reproduction as it passes from the circular to the spiral form is clearly a very slow procedure compared with centralisation which has only to change the quantitative groupings of the constituent parts of social capital the world would still be without railways if it had had to wait until accumulation had got a few individual capitals far enough to be adequate for the construction of a railway centralisation on the contrary accomplished this in the twinkling of an eye by means of jointstock companies and whilst centralisation thus intensifies and accelerates the effects of accumulation it simultaneously extends and speeds those revolutions in the technical composition of capital which raise its constant portion at the expense of its variable portion thus diminishing the relative demand for labour the masses of capital fused together overnight by centralisation reproduce and multiply as the others do only more rapidly thereby becoming new and powerful levers in social accumulation therefore when we speak of the progress of social accumulation we tacitly include – today – the effects of centralisation the additional capitals formed in the normal course of accumulation see chapter xxiv section serve particularly as vehicles for the exploitation of new inventions and discoveries and industrial improvements in general but in time the old capital also reaches the moment of renewal from top to toe when it sheds its skin and is reborn like the others in a perfected technical form in which a smaller quantity of labour will suffice to set in motion a larger quantity of machinery and raw materials the absolute reduction in the demand for labour which necessarily follows from this is obviously so much the greater the higher the degree in which the capitals undergoing this process of renewal are already massed together by virtue of the centralisation movement on the one hand therefore the additional capital formed in the course of accumulation attracts fewer and fewer labourers in proportion to its magnitude on the other hand the old capital periodically reproduced with change of composition repels more and more of the labourers formerly employed by it section progressive production of a relative surplus population or industrial reserve army the accumulation of capital though originally appearing as its quantitative extension only is effected as we have seen under a progressive qualitative change in its composition under a constant increase of its constant at the expense of its variable constituent the specifically capitalist mode of production the development of the productive power of labour corresponding to it and the change thence resulting in the organic composition of capital do not merely keep pace with the advance of accumulation or with the growth of social wealth they develop at a much quicker rate because mere accumulation the absolute increase of the total social capital is accompanied by the centralisation of the individual capitals of which that total is made up and because the change in the technological composition of the additional capital goes hand in hand with a similar change in the technological composition of the original capital with the advance of accumulation therefore the proportion of constant to variable capital changes if it was originally say it now becomes successively c so that as the capital increases instead of ½ of its total value only c is transformed into labourpower and on the other hand into means of production since the demand for labour is determined not by the amount of capital as a whole but by its variable constituent alone that demand falls progressively with the increase of the total capital instead of as previously assumed rising in proportion to it it falls relatively to the magnitude of the total capital and at an accelerated rate as this magnitude increases with the growth of the total capital its variable constituent or the labour incorporated in it also does increase but in a constantly diminishing proportion the intermediate pauses are shortened in which accumulation works as simple extension of production on a given technical basis it is not merely that an accelerated accumulation of total capital accelerated in a constantly growing progression is needed to absorb an additional number of labourers or even on account of the constant metamorphosis of old capital to keep employed those already functioning in its turn this increasing accumulation and centralisation becomes a source of new changes in the composition of capital of a more accelerated diminution of its variable as compared with its constant constituent this accelerated relative diminution of the variable constituent that goes along with the accelerated increase of the total capital and moves more rapidly than this increase takes the inverse form at the other pole of an apparently absolute increase of the labouring population an increase always moving more rapidly than that of the variable capital or the means of employment but in fact it is capitalistic accumulation itself that constantly produces and produces in the direct ratio of its own energy and extent a relatively redundant population of labourers ie a population of greater extent than suffices for the average needs of the selfexpansion of capital and therefore a surplus population considering the social capital in its totality the movement of its accumulation now causes periodical changes affecting it more or less as a whole now distributes its various phases simultaneously over the different spheres of production in some spheres a change in the composition of capital occurs without increase of its absolute magnitude as a consequence of simple centralisation in others the absolute growth of capital is connected with absolute diminution of its variable constituent or of the labour power absorbed by it in others again capital continues growing for a time on its given technical basis and attracts additional labour power in proportion to its increase while at other times it undergoes organic change and lessens its variable constituent in all spheres the increase of the variable part of capital and therefore of the number of labourers employed by it is always connected with violent fluctuations and transitory production of surplus population whether this takes the more striking form of the repulsion of labourers already employed or the less evident but not less real form of the more difficult absorption of the additional labouring population through the usual channels with the magnitude of social capital already functioning and the degree of its increase with the extension of the scale of production and the mass of the labourers set in motion with the development of the productiveness of their labour with the greater breadth and fulness of all sources of wealth there is also an extension of the scale on which greater attraction of labourers by capital is accompanied by their greater repulsion the rapidity of the change in the organic composition of capital and in its technical form increases and an increasing number of spheres of production becomes involved in this change now simultaneously now alternately the labouring population therefore produces along with the accumulation of capital produced by it the means by which it itself is made relatively superfluous is turned into a relative surplus population and it does this to an always increasing extent this is a law of population peculiar to the capitalist mode of production and in fact every special historic mode of production has its own special laws of population historically valid within its limits and only in so far as man has not interfered with them but if a surplus labouring population is a necessary product of accumulation or of the development of wealth on a capitalist basis this surplus population becomes conversely the lever of capitalistic accumulation nay a condition of existence of the capitalist mode of production it forms a disposable industrial reserve army that belongs to capital quite as absolutely as if the latter had bred it at its own cost independently of the limits of the actual increase of population it creates for the changing needs of the selfexpansion of capital a mass of human material always ready for exploitation with accumulation and the development of the productiveness of labour that accompanies it the power of sudden expansion of capital grows also it grows not merely because the elasticity of the capital already functioning increases not merely because the absolute wealth of society expands of which capital only forms an elastic part not merely because credit under every special stimulus at once places an unusual part of this wealth at the disposal of production in the form of additional capital it grows also because the technical conditions of the process of production themselves – machinery means of transport c – now admit of the rapidest transformation of masses of surplusproduct into additional means of production the mass of social wealth overflowing with the advance of accumulation and transformable into additional capital thrusts itself frantically into old branches of production whose market suddenly expands or into newly formed branches such as railways c the need for which grows out of the development of the old ones in all such cases there must be the possibility of throwing great masses of men suddenly on the decisive points without injury to the scale of production in other spheres overpopulation supplies these masses the course characteristic of modern industry viz a decennial cycle interrupted by smaller oscillations of periods of average activity production at high pressure crisis and stagnation depends on the constant formation the greater or less absorption and the reformation of the industrial reserve army or surplus population in their turn the varying phases of the industrial cycle recruit the surplus population and become one of the most energetic agents of its reproduction this peculiar course of modern industry which occurs in no earlier period of human history was also impossible in the childhood of capitalist production the composition of capital changed but very slowly with its accumulation therefore there kept pace on the whole a corresponding growth in the demand for labour slow as was the advance of accumulation compared with that of more modern times it found a check in the natural limits of the exploitable labouring population limits which could only be got rid of by forcible means to be mentioned later the expansion by fits and starts of the scale of production is the preliminary to its equally sudden contraction the latter again evokes the former but the former is impossible without disposable human material without an increase in the number of labourers independently of the absolute growth of the population this increase is effected by the simple process that constantly “sets free” a part of the labourers by methods which lessen the number of labourers employed in proportion to the increased production the whole form of the movement of modern industry depends therefore upon the constant transformation of a part of the labouring population into unemployed or halfemployed hands the superficiality of political economy shows itself in the fact that it looks upon the expansion and contraction of credit which is a mere symptom of the periodic changes of the industrial cycle as their cause as the heavenly bodies once thrown into a certain definite motion always repeat this so is it with social production as soon as it is once thrown into this movement of alternate expansion and contraction effects in their turn become causes and the varying accidents of the whole process which always reproduces its own conditions take on the form of periodicity when this periodicity is once consolidated even political economy then sees that the production of a relative surplus population – ie surplus with regard to the average needs of the selfexpansion of capital – is a necessary condition of modern industry “suppose” says h merivale formerly professor of political economy at oxford subsequently employed in the english colonial office “suppose that on the occasion of some of these crises the nation were to rouse itself to the effort of getting rid by emigration of some hundreds of thousands of superfluous arms what would be the consequence that at the first returning demand for labour there would be a deficiency however rapid reproduction may be it takes at all events the space of a generation to replace the loss of adult labour now the profits of our manufacturers depend mainly on the power of making use of the prosperous moment when demand is brisk and thus compensating themselves for the interval during which it is slack this power is secured to them only by the command of machinery and of manual labour they must have hands ready by them they must be able to increase the activity of their operations when required and to slacken it again according to the state of the market or they cannot possibly maintain that preeminence in the race of competition on which the wealth of the country is founded” even malthus recognises overpopulation as a necessity of modern industry though after his narrow fashion he explains it by the absolute overgrowth of the labouring population not by their becoming relatively supernumerary he says “prudential habits with regard to marriage carried to a considerable extent among the labouring class of a country mainly depending upon manufactures and commerce might injure it from the nature of a population an increase of labourers cannot be brought into market in consequence of a particular demand till after the lapse of or years and the conversion of revenue into capital by saving may take place much more rapidly a country is always liable to an increase in the quantity of the funds for the maintenance of labour faster than the increase of population” after political economy has thus demonstrated the constant production of a relative surplus population of labourers to be a necessity of capitalistic accumulation she very aptly in the guise of an old maid puts in the mouth of her “beau ideal” of a capitalist the following words addressed to those supernumeraries thrown on the streets by their own creation of additional capital – “we manufacturers do what we can for you whilst we are increasing that capital on which you must subsist and you must do the rest by accommodating your numbers to the means of subsistence” capitalist production can by no means content itself with the quantity of disposable labour power which the natural increase of population yields it requires for its free play an industrial reserve army independent of these natural limits up to this point it has been assumed that the increase or diminution of the variable capital corresponds rigidly with the increase or diminution of the number of labourers employed the number of labourers commanded by capital may remain the same or even fall while the variable capital increases this is the case if the individual labourer yields more labour and therefore his wages increase and this although the price of labour remains the same or even falls only more slowly than the mass of labour rises increase of variable capital in this case becomes an index of more labour but not of more labourers employed it is the absolute interest of every capitalist to press a given quantity of labour out of a smaller rather than a greater number of labourers if the cost is about the same in the latter case the outlay of constant capital increases in proportion to the mass of labour set in action in the former that increase is much smaller the more extended the scale of production the stronger this motive its force increases with the accumulation of capital we have seen that the development of the capitalist mode of production and of the productive power of labour – at once the cause and effect of accumulation – enables the capitalist with the same outlay of variable capital to set in action more labour by greater exploitation extensive or intensive of each individual labour power we have further seen that the capitalist buys with the same capital a greater mass of labour power as he progressively replaces skilled labourers by less skilled mature labour power by immature male by female that of adults by that of young persons or children on the one hand therefore with the progress of accumulation a larger variable capital sets more labour in action without enlisting more labourers on the other a variable capital of the same magnitude sets in action more labour with the same mass of labour power and finally a greater number of inferior labour powers by displacement of higher the production of a relative surplus population or the setting free of labourers goes on therefore yet more rapidly than the technical revolution of the process of production that accompanies and is accelerated by the advance of accumulation and more rapidly than the corresponding diminution of the variable part of capital as compared with the constant if the means of production as they increase in extent and effective power become to a less extent means of employment of labourers this state of things is again modified by the fact that in proportion as the productiveness of labour increases capital increases its supply of labour more quickly than its demand for labourers the overwork of the employed part of the working class swells the ranks of the reserve whilst conversely the greater pressure that the latter by its competition exerts on the former forces these to submit to overwork and to subjugation under the dictates of capital the condemnation of one part of the working class to enforced idleness by the overwork of the other part and the converse becomes a means of enriching the individual capitalists and accelerates at the same time the production of the industrial reserve army on a scale corresponding with the advance of social accumulation how important is this element in the formation of the relative surplus population is shown by the example of england her technical means for saving labour are colossal nevertheless if tomorrow morning labour generally were reduced to a rational amount and proportioned to the different sections of the working class according to age and sex the working population to hand would be absolutely insufficient for the carrying on of national production on its present scale the great majority of the labourers now “unproductive” would have to be turned into “productive” ones taking them as a whole the general movements of wages are exclusively regulated by the expansion and contraction of the industrial reserve army and these again correspond to the periodic changes of the industrial cycle they are therefore not determined by the variations of the absolute number of the working population but by the varying proportions in which the working class is divided into active and reserve army by the increase or diminution in the relative amount of the surplus population by the extent to which it is now absorbed now set free for modern industry with its decennial cycles and periodic phases which moreover as accumulation advances are complicated by irregular oscillations following each other more and more quickly that would indeed be a beautiful law which pretends to make the action of capital dependent on the absolute variation of the population instead of regulating the demand and supply of labour by the alternate expansion and contraction of capital the labourmarket now appearing relatively underfull because capital is expanding now again overfull because it is contracting yet this is the dogma of the economists according to them wages rise in consequence of accumulation of capital the higher wages stimulate the working population to more rapid multiplication and this goes on until the labourmarket becomes too full and therefore capital relatively to the supply of labour becomes insufficient wages fall and now we have the reverse of the medal the working population is little by little decimated as the result of the fall in wages so that capital is again in excess relatively to them or as others explain it falling wages and the corresponding increase in the exploitation of the labourer again accelerates accumulation whilst at the same time the lower wages hold the increase of the working class in check then comes again the time when the supply of labour is less than the demand wages rise and so on a beautiful mode of motion this for developed capitalist production before in consequence of the rise of wages any positive increase of the population really fit for work could occur the time would have been passed again and again during which the industrial campaign must have been carried through the battle fought and won between and a rise of wages practically insignificant though accompanied by falling prices of corn took place in the english agricultural districts in wiltshire eg the weekly wages rose from s to s in dorsetshire from s or s to s c this was the result of an unusual exodus of the agricultural surplus population caused by the demands of war the vast extension of railroads factories mines c the lower the wages the higher is the proportion in which ever so insignificant a rise of them expresses itself if the weekly wage eg is s and it rises to s that is a rise of per cent but if it is only s and it rises to s that is a rise of per cent which sounds very fine everywhere the farmers were howling and the london economist with reference to these starvationwages prattled quite seriously of “a general and substantial advance” what did the farmers do now did they wait until in consequence of this brilliant remuneration the agricultural labourers had so increased and multiplied that their wages must fall again as prescribed by the dogmatic economic brain they introduced more machinery and in a moment the labourers were redundant again in a proportion satisfactory even to the farmers there was now “more capital” laid out in agriculture than before and in a more productive form with this the demand for labour fell not only relatively but absolutely the above economic fiction confuses the laws that regulate the general movement of wages or the ratio between the working class – ie the total labour power – and the total social capital with the laws that distribute the working population over the different spheres of production if eg in consequence of favourable circumstances accumulation in a particular sphere of production becomes especially active and profits in it being greater than the average profits attract additional capital of course the demand for labour rises and wages also rise the higher wages draw a larger part of the working population into the more favoured sphere until it is glutted with labour power and wages at length fall again to their average level or below it if the pressure is too great then not only does the immigration of labourers into the branch of industry in question cease it gives place to their emigration here the political economist thinks he sees the why and wherefore of an absolute increase of workers accompanying an increase of wages and of a diminution of wages accompanying an absolute increase of labourers but he sees really only the local oscillation of the labourmarket in a particular sphere of production – he sees only the phenomena accompanying the distribution of the working population into the different spheres of outlay of capital according to its varying needs the industrial reserve army during the periods of stagnation and average prosperity weighs down the active labourarmy during the periods of overproduction and paroxysm it holds its pretensions in check relative surplus population is therefore the pivot upon which the law of demand and supply of labour works it confines the field of action of this law within the limits absolutely convenient to the activity of exploitation and to the domination of capital this is the place to return to one of the grand exploits of economic apologetics it will be remembered that if through the introduction of new or the extension of old machinery a portion of variable capital is transformed into constant the economic apologist interprets this operation which “fixes” capital and by that very act sets labourers “free” in exactly the opposite way pretending that it sets free capital for the labourers only now can one fully understand the effrontery of these apologists what are set free are not only the labourers immediately turned out by the machines but also their future substitutes in the rising generation and the additional contingent that with the usual extension of trade on the old basis would be regularly absorbed they are now all “set free” and every new bit of capital looking out for employment can dispose of them whether it attracts them or others the effect on the general labour demand will be nil if this capital is just sufficient to take out of the market as many labourers as the machines threw upon it if it employs a smaller number that of the supernumeraries increases if it employs a greater the general demand for labour only increases to the extent of the excess of the employed over those “set free” the impulse that additional capital seeking an outlet would otherwise have given to the general demand for labour is therefore in every case neutralised to the extent of the labourers thrown out of employment by the machine that is to say the mechanism of capitalistic production so manages matters that the absolute increase of capital is accompanied by no corresponding rise in the general demand for labour and this the apologist calls a compensation for the misery the sufferings the possible death of the displaced labourers during the transition period that banishes them into the industrial reserve army the demand for labour is not identical with increase of capital nor supply of labour with increase of the working class it is not a case of two independent forces working on one another les dés sont pipés capital works on both sides at the same time if its accumulation on the one hand increases the demand for labour it increases on the other the supply of labourers by the “setting free” of them whilst at the same time the pressure of the unemployed compels those that are employed to furnish more labour and therefore makes the supply of labour to a certain extent independent of the supply of labourers the action of the law of supply and demand of labour on this basis completes the despotism of capital as soon therefore as the labourers learn the secret how it comes to pass that in the same measure as they work more as they produce more wealth for others and as the productive power of their labour increases so in the same measure even their function as a means of the selfexpansion of capital becomes more and more precarious for them as soon as they discover that the degree of intensity of the competition among themselves depends wholly on the pressure of the relative surplus population as soon as by trades’ unions c they try to organise a regular cooperation between employed and unemployed in order to destroy or to weaken the ruinous effects of this natural law of capitalistic production on their class so soon capital and its sycophant political economy cry out at the infringement of the “eternal” and so to say “sacred” law of supply and demand every combination of employed and unemployed disturbs the “harmonious” action of this law but on the other hand as soon as in the colonies eg adverse circumstances prevent the creation of an industrial reserve army and with it the absolute dependence of the working class upon the capitalist class capital along with its commonplace sancho panza rebels against the “sacred” law of supply and demand and tries to check its inconvenient action by forcible means and state interference section different forms of the relative surplus population the general law of capitalistic accumulation the relative surplus population exists in every possible form every labourer belongs to it during the time when he is only partially employed or wholly unemployed not taking into account the great periodically recurring forms that the changing phases of the industrial cycle impress on it now an acute form during the crisis then again a chronic form during dull times – it has always three forms the floating the latent the stagnant in the centres of modern industry – factories manufactures ironworks mines c – the labourers are sometimes repelled sometimes attracted again in greater masses the number of those employed increasing on the whole although in a constantly decreasing proportion to the scale of production here the surplus population exists in the floating form in the automatic factories as in all the great workshops where machinery enters as a factor or where only the modern division of labour is carried out large numbers of boys are employed up to the age of maturity when this term is once reached only a very small number continue to find employment in the same branches of industry whilst the majority are regularly discharged this majority forms an element of the floating surplus population growing with the extension of those branches of industry part of them emigrates following in fact capital that has emigrated one consequence is that the female population grows more rapidly than the male teste england that the natural increase of the number of labourers does not satisfy the requirements of the accumulation of capital and yet all the time is in excess of them is a contradiction inherent to the movement of capital itself it wants larger numbers of youthful labourers a smaller number of adults the contradiction is not more glaring than that other one that there is a complaint of the want of hands while at the same time many thousands are out of work because the division of labour chains them to a particular branch of industry the consumption of labour power by capital is besides so rapid that the labourer halfway through his life has already more or less completely lived himself out he falls into the ranks of the supernumeraries or is thrust down from a higher to a lower step in the scale it is precisely among the workpeople of modern industry that we meet with the shortest duration of life dr lee medical officer of health for manchester stated “that the average age at death of the manchester upper middle class was years while the average age at death of the labouring class was while at liverpool those figures were represented as against it thus appeared that the welltodo classes had a lease of life which was more than double the value of that which fell to the lot of the less favoured citizens” in order to conform to these circumstances the absolute increase of this section of the proletariat must take place under conditions that shall swell their numbers although the individual elements are used up rapidly hence rapid renewal of the generations of labourers this law does not hold for the other classes of the population this social need is met by early marriages a necessary consequence of the conditions in which the labourers of modern industry live and by the premium that the exploitation of children sets on their production as soon as capitalist production takes possession of agriculture and in proportion to the extent to which it does so the demand for an agricultural labouring population falls absolutely while the accumulation of the capital employed in agriculture advances without this repulsion being as in nonagricultural industries compensated by a greater attraction part of the agricultural population is therefore constantly on the point of passing over into an urban or manufacturing proletariat and on the lookout for circumstances favourable to this transformation manufacture is used here in the sense of all nonagricultural industries this source of relative surplus population is thus constantly flowing but the constant flow towards the towns presupposes in the country itself a constant latent surplus population the extent of which becomes evident only when its channels of outlet open to exceptional width the agricultural labourer is therefore reduced to the minimum of wages and always stands with one foot already in the swamp of pauperism the third category of the relative surplus population the stagnant forms a part of the active labour army but with extremely irregular employment hence it furnishes to capital an inexhaustible reservoir of disposable labour power its conditions of life sink below the average normal level of the working class this makes it at once the broad basis of special branches of capitalist exploitation it is characterised by maximum of workingtime and minimum of wages we have learnt to know its chief form under the rubric of “domestic industry” it recruits itself constantly from the supernumerary forces of modern industry and agriculture and specially from those decaying branches of industry where handicraft is yielding to manufacture manufacture to machinery its extent grows as with the extent and energy of accumulation the creation of a surplus population advances but it forms at the same time a selfreproducing and selfperpetuating element of the working class taking a proportionally greater part in the general increase of that class than the other elements in fact not only the number of births and deaths but the absolute size of the families stand in inverse proportion to the height of wages and therefore to the amount of means of subsistence of which the different categories of labourers dispose this law of capitalistic society would sound absurd to savages or even civilised colonists it calls to mind the boundless reproduction of animals individually weak and constantly hunted down the lowest sediment of the relative surplus population finally dwells in the sphere of pauperism exclusive of vagabonds criminals prostitutes in a word the “dangerous” classes this layer of society consists of three categories first those able to work one need only glance superficially at the statistics of english pauperism to find that the quantity of paupers increases with every crisis and diminishes with every revival of trade second orphans and pauper children these are candidates for the industrial reserve army and are in times of great prosperity as eg speedily and in large numbers enrolled in the active army of labourers third the demoralised and ragged and those unable to work chiefly people who succumb to their incapacity for adaptation due to the division of labour people who have passed the normal age of the labourer the victims of industry whose number increases with the increase of dangerous machinery of mines chemical works c the mutilated the sickly the widows c pauperism is the hospital of the active labourarmy and the dead weight of the industrial reserve army its production is included in that of the relative surplus population its necessity in theirs along with the surplus population pauperism forms a condition of capitalist production and of the capitalist development of wealth it enters into the faux frais of capitalist production but capital knows how to throw these for the most part from its own shoulders on to those of the working class and the lower middle class the greater the social wealth the functioning capital the extent and energy of its growth and therefore also the absolute mass of the proletariat and the productiveness of its labour the greater is the industrial reserve army the same causes which develop the expansive power of capital develop also the labour power at its disposal the relative mass of the industrial reserve army increases therefore with the potential energy of wealth but the greater this reserve army in proportion to the active labour army the greater is the mass of a consolidated surplus population whose misery is in inverse ratio to its torment of labour the more extensive finally the lazarus layers of the working class and the industrial reserve army the greater is official pauperism this is the absolute general law of capitalist accumulation like all other laws it is modified in its working by many circumstances the analysis of which does not concern us here the folly is now patent of the economic wisdom that preaches to the labourers the accommodation of their number to the requirements of capital the mechanism of capitalist production and accumulation constantly effects this adjustment the first word of this adaptation is the creation of a relative surplus population or industrial reserve army its last word is the misery of constantly extending strata of the active army of labour and the dead weight of pauperism the law by which a constantly increasing quantity of means of production thanks to the advance in the productiveness of social labour may be set in movement by a progressively diminishing expenditure of human power this law in a capitalist society – where the labourer does not employ the means of production but the means of production employ the labourer – undergoes a complete inversion and is expressed thus the higher the productiveness of labour the greater is the pressure of the labourers on the means of employment the more precarious therefore becomes their condition of existence viz the sale of their own labour power for the increasing of another’s wealth or for the selfexpansion of capital the fact that the means of production and the productiveness of labour increase more rapidly than the productive population expresses itself therefore capitalistically in the inverse form that the labouring population always increases more rapidly than the conditions under which capital can employ this increase for its own selfexpansion we saw in part iv when analysing the production of relative surplusvalue within the capitalist system all methods for raising the social productiveness of labour are brought about at the cost of the individual labourer all means for the development of production transform themselves into means of domination over and exploitation of the producers they mutilate the labourer into a fragment of a man degrade him to the level of an appendage of a machine destroy every remnant of charm in his work and turn it into a hated toil they estrange from him the intellectual potentialities of the labour process in the same proportion as science is incorporated in it as an independent power they distort the conditions under which he works subject him during the labour process to a despotism the more hateful for its meanness they transform his lifetime into workingtime and drag his wife and child beneath the wheels of the juggernaut of capital but all methods for the production of surplusvalue are at the same time methods of accumulation and every extension of accumulation becomes again a means for the development of those methods it follows therefore that in proportion as capital accumulates the lot of the labourer be his payment high or low must grow worse the law finally that always equilibrates the relative surplus population or industrial reserve army to the extent and energy of accumulation this law rivets the labourer to capital more firmly than the wedges of vulcan did prometheus to the rock it establishes an accumulation of misery corresponding with accumulation of capital accumulation of wealth at one pole is therefore at the same time accumulation of misery agony of toil slavery ignorance brutality mental degradation at the opposite pole ie on the side of the class that produces its own product in the form of capital this antagonistic character of capitalistic accumulation is enunciated in various forms by political economists although by them it is confounded with phenomena certainly to some extent analogous but nevertheless essentially distinct and belonging to precapitalistic modes of production the venetian monk ortes one of the great economic writers of the th century regards the antagonism of capitalist production as a general natural law of social wealth “in the economy of a nation advantages and evils always balance one another il bene ed il male economico in una nazione sempre all istessa misura the abundance of wealth with some people is always equal to the want of it with others la copia dei beni in alcuni sempre eguale alia mancanza di essi in altri the great riches of a small number are always accompanied by the absolute privation of the first necessaries of life for many others the wealth of a nation corresponds with its population and its misery corresponds with its wealth diligence in some compels idleness in others the poor and idle are a necessary consequence of the rich and active” c in a thoroughly brutal way about years after ortes the church of england parson townsend glorified misery as a necessary condition of wealth “legal constraint to labour is attended with too much trouble violence and noise whereas hunger is not only a peaceable silent unremitted pressure but as the most natural motive to industry and labour it calls forth the most powerful exertions” everything therefore depends upon making hunger permanent among the working class and for this according to townsend the principle of population especially active among the poor provides “it seems to be a law of nature that the poor should be to a certain degree improvident” ie so improvident as to be born without a silver spoon in the mouth “that there may always be some to fulfil the most servile the most sordid and the most ignoble offices in the community the stock of human happiness is thereby much increased whilst the more delicate are not only relieved from drudgery but are left at liberty without interruption to pursue those callings which are suited to their various dispositions it” the poor law “tends to destroy the harmony and beauty the symmetry and order of that system which god and nature have established in the world” if the venetian monk found in the fatal destiny that makes misery eternal the raison d’être of christian charity celibacy monasteries and holy houses the protestant prebendary finds in it a pretext for condemning the laws in virtue of which the poor possessed a right to a miserable public relief “the progress of social wealth” says storch “begets this useful class of society which performs the most wearisome the vilest the most disgusting functions which takes in a word on its shoulders all that is disagreeable and servile in life and procures thus for other classes leisure serenity of mind and conventional” c’est bon “dignity of character” storch asks himself in what then really consists the progress of this capitalistic civilisation with its misery and its degradation of the masses as compared with barbarism he finds but one answer security “thanks to the advance of industry and science” says sismondi “every labourer can produce every day much more than his consumption requires but at the same time whilst his labour produces wealth that wealth would were he called on to consume it himself make him less fit for labour” according to him “men” ie nonworkers “would probably prefer to do without all artistic perfection and all the enjoyments that manufacturers procure for us if it were necessary that all should buy them by constant toil like that of the labourer exertion today is separated from its recompense it is not the same man that first works and then reposes but it is because the one works that the other rests the indefinite multiplication of the productive powers of labour can then only have for result the increase of luxury and enjoyment of the idle rich” finally destutt de tracy the fishblooded bourgeois doctrinaire blurts out brutally “in poor nations the people are comfortable in rich nations they are generally poor” section illustrations of the general law of capitalist accumulation a england from no period of modern society is so favourable for the study of capitalist accumulation as the period of the last years it is as if this period had found fortunatus’ purse but of all countries england again furnishes the classical example because it holds the foremost place in the worldmarket because capitalist production is here alone completely developed and lastly because the introduction of the freetrade millennium since has cut off the last retreat of vulgar economy the titanic advance of production – the latter half of the years’ period again far surpassing the former – has been already pointed out sufficiently in part iv although the absolute increase of the english population in the last half century was very great the relative increase or rate of growth fell constantly as the following table borrowed from the census shows annual increase per cent of the population of england and wales in decimal numbers per cent per cent per cent per cent per cent let us now on the other hand consider the increase of wealth here the movement of profit rent of land c that come under the income tax furnishes the surest basis the increase of profits liable to income tax farmers and some other categories not included in great britain from to amounted to or as the annual average that of the population during the same period to about the augmentation of the rent of land subject to taxation including houses railways mines fisheries c amounted for to to or annually under this head the following categories show the greatest increase excess of annual income of over that of increase per year houses quarries mines ironworks fisheries gasworks railways if we compare the years from to in three sets of four consecutive years each the rate of augmentation of the income increases constantly it is eg for that arising from profits between to yearly and for yearly the sum of the incomes of the united kingdom that come under the income tax was in £ in £ in £ in £ in £ in £ the accumulation of capital was attended at the same time by its concentration and centralisation although no official statistics of agriculture existed for england they did for ireland they were voluntarily given in counties these statistics gave the result that from to the number of farms of less than acres had fallen from to so that had been thrown together into larger farms from to no personal estate of more than £ came under the succession duty from to however did and from to june ie in ½ years the centralisation will however be best seen from a short analysis of the income

scotland amounted in to £ in to £ the number of persons taxed were in out of a population of in out of a population of the following table shows the distribution of these incomes in the two years year

examples one understands the cry of triumph of the registrargeneral of the british people “rapidly as the population has increased it has not kept pace with the progress of industry and wealth” let us turn now to the direct agents of this industry or the producers of this wealth to the working class “it is one of the most melancholy features in the social state of this country” says gladstone “that while there was a decrease in the consuming powers of the people and while there was an increase in the privations and distress of the labouring class and operatives there was at the same time a constant accumulation of wealth in the upper classes and a constant increase of capital” thus spake this unctuous minister in the house of commons of february th on april th years later in the speech in which he introduced his budget “from to the taxable income of the country increased by per cent in the years from to it had increased from the basis taken in by per cent the fact is so astonishing as to be almost incredible this intoxicating augmentation of wealth and power entirely confined to classes of property must be of indirect benefit to the labouring population because it cheapens the commodities of general consumption while the rich have been growing richer the poor have been growing less poor at any rate whether the extremes of poverty are less i do not presume to say” how lame an anticlimax if the working class has remained “poor” only “less poor” in proportion as it produces for the wealthy class “an intoxicating augmentation of wealth and power” then it has remained relatively just as poor if the extremes of poverty have not lessened they have increased because the extremes of wealth have as to the cheapening of the means of subsistence the official statistics eg the accounts of the london orphan asylum show an increase in price of for the average of the three years compared with in the following three years there was a progressive rise in the price of meat butter milk sugar salt coals and a number of other necessary means of subsistence gladstone’s next budget speech of april th is a pindaric dithyrambus on the advance of surplusvaluemaking and the happiness of the people “tempered by poverty” he speaks of masses “on the border” of pauperism of branches of trade in which “wages have not increased” and finally sums up the happiness of the working class in the words “human life is but in nine cases out of ten a struggle for existence” professor fawcett not bound like gladstone by official considerations declares roundly “i do not of course deny that money wages have been augmented by this increase of capital in the last ten years but this apparent advantage is to a great extent lost because many of the necessaries of life are becoming dearer” he believes because of the fall in value of the precious metalsthe rich grow rapidly richer whilst there is no perceptible advance in the comfort enjoyed by the industrial classes they the labourers become almost the slaves of the tradesman to whom they owe money” in the chapters on the “working day” and “machinery” the reader has seen under what circumstances the british working class created an “intoxicating augmentation of wealth and power” for the propertied classes there we were chiefly concerned with the social functioning of the labourer but for a full elucidation of the law of accumulation his condition outside the workshop must also be looked at his condition as to food and dwelling the limits of this book compel us to concern ourselves chiefly with the worst paid part of the industrial proletariat and with the agricultural labourers who together form the majority of the working class but first one word on official pauperism or on that part of the working class which has forfeited its condition of existence the sale of labour power and vegetates upon public alms the official list of paupers numbered in england persons in in in consequence of the cotton famine it grew in the years and to and the crisis of which fell most heavily on london created in this centre of the world market more populous than the kingdom of scotland an increase of pauperism for the year of compared with and of compared with and a still greater increase for the first months of as compared with from the analysis of the statistics of pauperism two points are to be taken on the one hand the fluctuation up and down of the number of paupers reflects the periodic changes of the industrial cycle on the other the official statistics become more and more misleading as to the actual extent of pauperism in proportion as with the accumulation of capital the classstruggle and therefore the class consciousness of the working men develop eg the barbarity in the treatment of the paupers at which the english press the times pall mall gazette etc have cried out so loudly during the last two years is of ancient date f engels showed in exactly the same horrors exactly the same transient canting outcries of “sensational literature” but frightful increase of “deaths by starvation” in london during the last ten years proves beyond doubt the growing horror in which the workingpeople hold the slavery of the workhouse that place of punishment for misery b the badly paid strata of the british industrial class during the cotton famine of dr smith was charged by the privy council with an inquiry into the conditions of nourishment of the distressed operatives in lancashire and cheshire his observations during many preceding years had led him to the conclusion that “to avert starvation diseases” the daily food of an average woman ought to contain at least grains of carbon with grains of nitrogen the daily food of an average man at least grains of carbon with grains of nitrogen for women about the same quantity of nutritive elements as are contained in lbs of good wheaten bread for men more for the weekly average of adult men and women at least grains of carbon and grains of nitrogen his calculation was practically confirmed in a surprising manner by its agreement with the miserable quantity of nourishment to which want had forced down the consumption of the cotton operatives this was in december grains of carbon and grains of nitrogen weekly in the year the privy council ordered an inquiry into the state of distress of the worstnourished part of the english working class dr simon medical officer to the privy council chose for this work the abovementioned dr smith his inquiry ranges on the one hand over the agricultural labourers on the other over silkweavers needlewomen kidglovers stockingweavers gloveweavers and shoemakers the latter categories are with the exception of the stockingweavers exclusively towndwellers it was made a rule in the inquiry to select in each category the most healthy families and those comparatively in the best circumstances as a general result it was found that “in only one of the examined classes of indoor operatives did the average nitrogen supply just exceed while in another it nearly reached the estimated standard of bare sufficiency ie sufficient to avert starvation diseases and that in two classes there was defect – in one a very large defect – of both nitrogen and carbon moreover as regards the examined families of the agricultural population it appeared that more than a fifth were with less than the estimated sufficiency of carbonaceous food that more than onethird were with less than the estimated sufficiency of nitrogenous food and that in three counties berkshire oxfordshire and somersetshire insufficiency of nitrogenous food was the average local diet” among the agricultural labourers those of england the wealthiest part of the united kingdom were the worst fed the insufficiency of food among the agricultural labourers fell as a rule chiefly on the women and children for “the man must eat to do his work” still greater penury ravaged the townworkers examined “they are so ill fed that assuredly among them there must be many cases of severe and injurious privation” “privation” of the capitalist all this ie “abstinence” from paying for the means of subsistence absolutely necessary for the mere vegetation of his “hands” the following table shows the conditions of nourishment of the abovenamed categories of purely towndwelling workpeople as compared with the minimum assumed by dr smith and with the foodallowance of the cotton operatives during the time of their greatest distress both sexes average weekly carbon average weekly nitrogen five indoor occupations grains grains unemployed lancashire operatives grains grains minimum quantity to be allowed to the lancashire operatives equal number of males and females grains grains one half or of the industrial labour categories investigated had absolutely no beer no milk the weekly average of the liquid means of nourishment in the families varied from seven ounces in the needlewomen to ¾ ounces in the stockingmakers the majority of those who did not obtain milk were needlewomen in london the quantity of breadstuffs consumed weekly varied from ¾ lbs for the needlewomen to ½ lbs for the shoemakers and gave a total average of lbs per adult weekly sugar treacle etc varied from ounces weekly for the kidglovers to ounces for the stockingmakers and the total average per week for all categories was ounces per adult weekly total weekly average of butter fat etc ounces per adult the weekly average of meat bacon etc varied from ¼ ounces for the silkweavers to ¼ ounces for the kidglovers total average for the different categories ounces the weekly cost of food per adult gave the following average figures silkweavers s ½d needlewomen s d kidglovers s ½d shoemakers s ¾d stockingweavers s ¼d for the silkweavers of macclesfield the average was only s ½d the worst categories were the needlewomen silkweavers and kidglovers of these facts dr simon in his general health report says “that cases are innumerable in which defective diet is the cause or the aggravator of disease can be affirmed by any one who is conversant with poor law medical practice or with the wards and outpatient rooms of hospitals yet in this point of view there is in my opinion a very important sanitary context to be added it must be remembered that privation of food is very reluctantly borne and that as a rule great poorness of diet will only come when other privations have preceded it long before insufficiency of diet is a matter of hygienic concern long before the physiologist would think of counting the grains of nitrogen and carbon which intervene between life and starvation the household will have been utterly destitute of material comfort clothing and fuel will have been even scantier than food – against inclemencies of weather there will have been no adequate protection – dwelling space will have been stinted to the degree in which overcrowding produces or increases disease of household utensils and furniture there will have been scarcely any ‒ even cleanliness will have been found costly or difficult and if there still be selfrespectful endeavours to maintain it every such endeavour will represent additional pangs of hunger the home too will be where shelter can be cheapest bought in quarters where commonly there is least fruit of sanitary supervision least drainage least scavenging least suppression of public nuisances least or worst water supply and if in town least light and air such are the sanitary dangers to which poverty is almost certainly exposed when it is poverty enough to imply scantiness of food and while the sum of them is of terrible magnitude against life the mere scantiness of food is in itself of very serious moment these are painful reflections especially when it is remembered that the poverty to which they advert is not the deserved poverty of idleness in all cases it is the poverty of working populations indeed as regards the indoor operatives the work which obtains the scanty pittance of food is for the most part excessively prolonged yet evidently it is only in a qualified sense that the work can be deemed selfsupporting and on a very large scale the nominal selfsupport can be only a circuit longer or shorter to pauperism” the intimate connexion between the pangs of hunger of the most industrious layers of the working class and the extravagant consumption coarse or refined of the rich for which capitalist accumulation is the basis reveals itself only when the economic laws are known it is otherwise with the “housing of the poor” every unprejudiced observer sees that the greater the centralisation of the means of production the greater is the corresponding heaping together of the labourers within a given space that therefore the swifter capitalistic accumulation the more miserable are the dwellings of the workingpeople “improvements” of towns accompanying the increase of wealth by the demolition of badly built quarters the erection of palaces for banks warehouses c the widening of streets for business traffic for the carriages of luxury and for the introduction of tramways c drive away the poor into even worse and more crowded hiding places on the other hand every one knows that the dearness of dwellings is in inverse ratio to their excellence and that the mines of misery are exploited by house speculators with more profit or less cost than ever were the mines of potosi the antagonistic character of capitalist accumulation and therefore of the capitalistic relations of property generally is here so evident that even the official english reports on this subject teem with heterodox onslaughts on “property and its rights” with the development of industry with the accumulation of capital with the growth and “improvement” of towns the evil makes such progress that the mere fear of contagious diseases which do not spare even “respectability” brought into existence from to no less than acts of parliament on sanitation and that the frightened bourgeois in some towns as liverpool glasgow c took strenuous measures through their municipalities nevertheless dr simon in his report of says “speaking generally it may be said that the evils are uncontrolled in england” by order of the privy council in an inquiry was made into the conditions of the housing of the agricultural labourers in of the poorer classes in the towns the results of the admirable work of dr julian hunter are to be found in the seventh and eighth reports on “public health” to the agricultural labourers i shall come later on the condition of town dwellings i quote as preliminary a general remark of dr simon “although my official point of view” he says “is one exclusively physical common humanity requires that the other aspect of this evil should not be ignored in its higher degrees it ie overcrowding almost necessarily involves such negation of all delicacy such unclean confusion of bodies and bodily functions such exposure of animal and sexual nakedness as is rather bestial than human to be subject to these influences is a degradation which must become deeper and deeper for those on whom it continues to work to children who are born under its curse it must often be a very baptism into infamy and beyond all measure hopeless is the wish that persons thus circumstanced should ever in other respects aspire to that atmosphere of civilisation which has its essence in physical and moral cleanliness” london takes the first place in overcrowded habitations absolutely unfit for human beings “he feels clear” says dr hunter “on two points first that there are about large colonies in london of about persons each whose miserable condition exceeds almost anything he has seen elsewhere in england and is almost entirely the result of their bad house accommodation and second that the crowded and dilapidated condition of the houses of these colonies is much worse than was the case years ago” “it is not too much to say that life in parts of london and newcastle is infernal” further the betteroff part of the working class together with the small shopkeepers and other elements of the lower middle class falls in london more and more under the curse of these vile conditions of dwelling in proportion as “improvements” and with them the demolition of old streets and houses advance as factories and the afflux of human beings grow in the metropolis and finally as house rents rise with the groundrents “rents have become so heavy that few labouring men can afford more than one room” there is almost no houseproperty in london that is not overburdened with a number of middlemen for the price of land in london is always very high in comparison with its yearly revenue and therefore every buyer speculates on getting rid of it again at a jury price the expropriation valuation fixed by jurymen or on pocketing an extraordinary increase of value arising from the neighbourhood of some large establishment as a consequence of this there is a regular trade in the purchase of “fagends of leases” “gentlemen in this business may be fairly expected to do as they do – get all they can from the tenants while they have them and leave as little as they can for their successors” the rents are weekly and these gentlemen run no risk in consequence of the making of railroads in the city “the spectacle has lately been seen in the east of london of a number of families wandering about some saturday night with their scanty worldly goods on their backs without any resting place but the workhouse” the workhouses are already overcrowded and the “improvements” already sanctioned by parliament are only just begun if labourers are driven away by the demolition of their old houses they do not leave their old parish or at most they settle down on its borders as near as they can get to it “they try of course to remain as near as possible to their workshops the inhabitants do not go beyond the same or the next parish parting their tworoom tenements into single rooms and crowding even those even at an advanced rent the people who are displaced will hardly be able to get an accommodation so good as the meagre one they have left half the workmen of the strand walked two miles to their work” this same strand a main thoroughfare which gives strangers an imposing idea of the wealth of london may serve as an example of the packing together of human beings in that town in one of its parishes the officer of health reckoned persons per acre although half the width of the thames was reckoned in it will be selfunderstood that every sanitary measure which as has been the case hitherto in london hunts the labourers from one quarter by demolishing uninhabitable houses serves only to crowd them together yet more closely in another “either” says dr hunter “the whole proceeding will of necessity stop as an absurdity or the public compassion be effectually aroused to the obligation which may now be without exaggeration called national of supplying cover to those who by reason of their having no capital cannot provide it for themselves though they can by periodical payments reward those who will provide it for them” admire this capitalistic justice the owner of land of houses the businessman when expropriated by “improvements” such as railroads the building of new streets c not only receives full indemnity he must according to law human and divine be comforted for his enforced “abstinence” over and above this by a thumping profit the labourer with his wife and child and chattels is thrown out into the street and – if he crowds in too large numbers towards quarters of the town where the vestries insist on decency he is prosecuted in the name of sanitation except london there was at the beginning of the th century no single town in england of inhabitants only five had more than now there are towns with more than inhabitants “the result of this change is not only that the class of town people is enormously increased but the old closepacked little towns are now centres built round on every side open nowhere to air and being no longer agreeable to the rich are abandoned by them for the pleasanter outskirts the successors of these rich are occupying the larger houses at the rate of a family to each room and find accommodation for two or three lodgers and a population for which the houses were not intended and quite unfit has been created whose surroundings are truly degrading to the adults and ruinous to the children” the more rapidly capital accumulates in an industrial or commercial town the more rapidly flows the stream of exploitable human material the more miserable are the improvised dwellings of the labourers newcastleontyne as the centre of a coal and iron district of growing productiveness takes the next place after london in the housing inferno not less than persons live there in single rooms because of their absolute danger to the community houses in great numbers have lately been destroyed by the authorities in newcastle and gateshead the building of new houses progresses very slowly business very quickly the town was therefore in more full than ever scarcely a room was to let dr embleton of the newcastle fever hospital says “there can be little doubt that the great cause of the continuance and spread of the typhus has been the overcrowding of human beings and the uncleanliness of their dwellings the rooms in which labourers in many cases live are situated in confined and unwholesome yards or courts and for space light air and cleanliness are models of insufficiency and insalubrity and a disgrace to any civilised community in them men women and children lie at night huddled together and as regards the men the nightshift succeed the dayshift and the dayshift the nightshift in unbroken series for some time together the beds having scarcely time to cool the whole house badly supplied with water and worse with privies dirty unventilated and pestiferous” the price per week of such lodgings ranges from d to s “the town of newcastleontyne” says dr hunter “contains a sample of the finest tribe of our countrymen often sunk by external circumstances of house and street into an almost savage degradation” as a result of the ebbing and flowing of capital and labour the state of the dwellings of an industrial town may today be bearable tomorrow hideous or the aedileship of the town may have pulled itself together for the removal of the most shocking abuses tomorrow like a swarm of locusts come crowding in masses of ragged irishmen or decayed english agricultural labourers they are stowed away in cellars and lofts or the hitherto respectable labourer’s dwelling is transformed into a lodging house whose personnel changes as quickly as the billets in the years’ war example bradford yorkshire there the municipal philistine was just busied with urban improvements besides there were still in bradford in uninhabited houses but now comes that revival of trade which the mildly liberal mr forster the negro’s friend recently crowed over with so much grace with the revival of trade came of course an overflow from the waves of the ever fluctuating “reserve army” or “relative surplus population” the frightful cellar habitations and rooms registered in the list which dr hunter obtained from the agent of an insurance company were for the most part inhabited by wellpaid labourers they declared that they would willingly pay for better dwellings if they were to be had meanwhile they become degraded they fall ill one and all whilst the mildly liberal forster m p sheds tears over the blessings of free trade and the profits of the eminent men of bradford who deal in worsted in the report of september dr bell one of the poor law doctors of bradford ascribes the frightful mortality of feverpatients in his district to the nature of their dwellings “in one small cellar measuring cubic feet there are ten persons vincent street green aire place and the leys include houses having inhabitants beds and privies the beds ‒ and in that term i include any roll of dirty old rags or an armful of shavings ‒ have an average of persons to each many have and persons to each and some people i am told are absolutely without beds they sleep in their ordinary clothes on the bare boards – young men and women married and unmarried all together i need scarcely add that many of these dwellings are dark damp dirty stinking holes utterly unfit for human habitations they are the centres from which disease and death are distributed amongst those in better circumstances who have allowed them thus to fester in our midst” bristol takes the third place after london in the misery of its dwellings “bristol where the blankest poverty and domestic misery abound in the wealthiest town of europe” c the nomad population we turn now to a class of people whose origin is agricultural but whose occupation is in great part industrial they are the light infantry of capital thrown by it according to its needs now to this point now to that when they are not on the march they “camp” nomad labour is used for various operations of building and draining brickmaking limeburning railwaymaking c a flying column of pestilence it carries into the places in whose neighbourhood it pitches its camp smallpox typhus cholera scarlet fever c in undertakings that involve much capital outlay such as railways c the contractor himself generally provides his army with wooden huts and the like thus improvising villages without any sanitary provisions outside the control of the local boards very profitable to the contractor who exploits the labourers in twofold fashion – as soldiers of industry and as tenants according as the wooden hut contains or holes its inhabitant navvy or whatever he may be has to pay or shillings weekly one example will suffice in september dr simon reports that the chairman of the nuisances removal committee of the parish of sevenoaks sent the following denunciation to sir george grey home secretary – “smallpox cases were rarely heard of in this parish until about twelve months ago shortly before that time the works for a railway from lewisham to tunbridge were commenced here and in addition to the principal works being in the immediate neighbourhood of this town here was also established the depôt for the whole of the works so that a large number of persons was of necessity employed here as cottage accommodation could not be obtained for them all huts were built in several places along the line of the works by the contractor mr jay for their especial occupation these huts possessed no ventilation nor drainage and besides were necessarily overcrowded because each occupant had to accommodate lodgers whatever the number in his own family might be although there were only two rooms to each tenement the consequences were according to the medical report we received that in the nighttime these poor people were compelled to endure all the horror of suffocation to avoid the pestiferous smells arising from the filthy stagnant water and the privies close under their windows complaints were at length made to the nuisances removal committee by a medical gentleman who had occasion to visit these huts and he spoke of their condition as dwellings in the most severe terms and he expressed his fears that some very serious consequences might ensue unless some sanitary measures were adopted about a year ago mr jay promised to appropriate a hut to which persons in his employ who were suffering from contagious diseases might at once be removed he repeated that promise on the rd july last but although since the date of the last promise there have been several cases of smallpox in his huts and two deaths from the same disease yet he has taken no steps whatever to carry out his promise on the th september instant mr kelson surgeon reported to me further cases of smallpox in the same huts and he described their condition as most disgraceful i should add for your the home secretary’s information that an isolated house called the pesthouse which is set apart for parishioners who might be suffering from infectious diseases has been continually occupied by such patients for many months past and is also now occupied that in one family five children died from smallpox and fever that from the st april to the st september this year a period of five months there have been no fewer than ten deaths from smallpox in the parish four of them being in the huts already referred to that it is impossible to ascertain the exact number of persons who have suffered from that disease although they are known to be many from the fact of the families keeping it as private as possible” the labourers in coal and other mines belong to the best paid categories of the british proletariat the price at which they buy their wages was shown on an earlier page here i merely cast a hurried glance over the conditions of their dwellings as a rule the exploiter of a mine whether its owner or his tenant builds a number of cottages for his hands they receive cottages and coal for firing “for nothing” – ie these form part of their wages paid in kind those who are not lodged in this way receive in compensation £ per annum the mining districts attract with rapidity a large population made up of the miners themselves and the artisans shopkeepers c that group themselves around them the groundrents are high as they are generally where population is dense the master tries therefore to run up within the smallest space possible at the mouth of the pit just so many cottages as are necessary to pack together his hands and their families if new mines are opened in the neighbourhood or old ones are again set working the pressure increases in the construction of the cottages only one point of view is of moment the “abstinence” of the capitalist from all expenditure that is not absolutely unavoidable “the lodging which is obtained by the pitman and other labourers connected with the collieries of northumberland and durham” says dr julian hunter “is perhaps on the whole the worst and the dearest of which any large specimens can be found in england the similar parishes of monmouthshire excepted the extreme badness is in the high number of men found in one room in the smallness of the groundplot on which a great number of houses are thrust the want of water the absence of privies and the frequent placing of one house on the top of another or distribution into flats the lessee acts as if the whole colony were encamped not resident” “in pursuance of my instructions” says dr stevens “i visited most of the large colliery villages in the durham union with very few exceptions the general statement that no means are taken to secure the health of the inhabitants would be true of all of them all colliers are bound bound’ an expression which like bondage dates from the age of serfdom to the colliery lessee or owner for twelve months if the colliers express discontent or in any way annoy the ‘viewer’ a mark of memorandum is made against their names and at the annual ‘binding’ such men are turned off it appears to me that no part of the ‘truck system’ could be worse than what obtains in these denselypopulated districts the collier is bound to take as part of his hiring a house surrounded with pestiferous influences he cannot help himself and it appears doubtful whether anyone else can help him except his proprietor he is to all intents and purposes a serf and his proprietor first consults his balancesheet and the result is tolerably certain the collier is also often supplied with water by the proprietor which whether it be good or bad he has to pay for or rather he suffers a deduction for from his wages” in conflict with “public opinion” or even with the officers of health capital makes no difficulty about “justifying” the conditions partly dangerous partly degrading to which it confines the working and domestic life of the labourer on the ground that they are necessary for profit it is the same thing when capital “abstains” from protective measures against dangerous machinery in the factory from appliances for ventilation and for safety in mines c it is the same here with the housing of the miners dr simon medical officer of the privy council in his official report says “in apology for the wretched household accommodation it is alleged that miners are commonly worked on lease that the duration of the lessee’s interest which in collieries is commonly for years is not so long that he should deem it worth his while to create good accommodation for his labourers and for the tradespeople and others whom the work attracts that even if he were disposed to act liberally in the matter this disposition would commonly be defeated by his landlord’s tendency to fix on him as groundrent an exorbitant additional charge for the privilege of having on the surface of the ground the decent and comfortable village which the labourers of the subterranean property ought to inhabit and that prohibitory price if not actual prohibition equally excludes others who might desire to build it would be foreign to the purpose of this report to enter upon any discussion of the merits of the above apology nor here is it even needful to consider where it would be that if decent accommodation were provided the cost would eventually fall – whether on landlord or lessee or labourer or public but in presence of such shameful facts as are vouched for in the annexed reports those of dr hunter dr stevens c a remedy may well be claimed claims of landlordship are being so used as to do great public wrong the landlord in his capacity of mineowner invites an industrial colony to labour on his estate and then in his capacity of surfaceowner makes it impossible that the labourers whom he collects should find proper lodging where they must live the lessee the capitalist exploiter meanwhile has no pecuniary motive for resisting that division of the bargain well knowing that if its latter conditions be exorbitant the consequences fall not on him that his labourers on whom they fall have not education enough to know the value of their sanitary rights that neither obscenest lodging nor foulest drinking water will be appreciable inducements towards a ‘strike’” d effect of crises on the best paid part of the working class before i turn to the regular agricultural labourers i may be allowed to show by one example how industrial revulsions affect even the bestpaid the aristocracy of the working class it will be remembered that the year brought one of the great crises with which the industrial cycle periodically ends the next termination of the cycle was due in already discounted in the regular factory districts by the cotton famine which threw much capital from its wonted sphere into the great centres of the moneymarket the crisis assumed at this time an especially financial character its outbreak in was signalised by the failure of a gigantic london bank immediately followed by the collapse of countless swindling companies one of the great london branches of industry involved in the catastrophe was iron shipbuilding the magnates of this trade had not only overproduced beyond all measure during the overtrading time but they had besides engaged in enormous contracts on the speculation that credit would be forthcoming to an equivalent extent now a terrible reaction set in that even at this hour the end of march continues in this and other london industries to show the condition of the labourers i quote the following from the circumstantial report of a correspondent of the morning star who at the end of and beginning of visited the chief centres of distress “in the east end districts of poplar millwall greenwich deptford limehouse and canning town at least workmen and their families were in a state of utter destitution and skilled mechanics were breaking stones in the workhouse yard after distress of over half a year’s duration i had great difficulty in reaching the workhouse door for a hungry crowd besieged it they were waiting for their tickets but the time had not yet arrived for the distribution the yard was a great square place with an open shed running all round it and several large heaps of snow covered the pavingstones in the middle in the middle also were little wickerfenced spaces like sheep pens where in finer weather the men worked but on the day of my visit the pens were so snowed up that nobody could sit in them men were busy however in the open shed breaking pavingstones into macadam each man had a big pavingstone for a seat and he chipped away at the rimecovered granite with a big hammer until he had broken up and think five bushels of it and then he had done his day’s work and got his day’s pay – threepence and an allowance of food in another part of the yard was a rickety little wooden house and when we opened the door of it we found it filled with men who were huddled together shoulder to shoulder for the warmth of one another’s bodies and breath they were picking oakum and disputing the while as to which could work the longest on a given quantity of food – for endurance was the point of honour seven thousand in this one workhouse were recipients of relief many hundreds of them it appeared were six or eight months ago earning the highest wages paid to artisans their number would be more than doubled by the count of those who having exhausted all their savings still refuse to apply to the parish because they have a little left to pawn leaving the workhouse i took a walk through the streets mostly of little onestorey houses that abound in the neighbourhood of poplar my guide was a member of the committee of the unemployed my first call was on an ironworker who had been seven and twenty weeks out of employment i found the man with his family sitting in a little back room the room was not bare of furniture and there was a fire in it this was necessary to keep the naked feet of the young children from getting frost bitten for it was a bitterly cold day on a tray in front of the fire lay a quantity of oakum which the wife and children were picking in return for their allowance from the parish the man worked in the stone yard of the workhouse for a certain ration of food and threepence per day he had now come home to dinner quite hungry as he told us with a melancholy smile and his dinner consisted of a couple of slices of bread and dripping and a cup of milkless tea the next door at which we knocked was opened by a middleaged woman who without saying a word led us into a little back parlour in which sat all her family silent and fixedly staring at a rapidly dying fire such desolation such hopelessness was about these people and their little room as i should not care to witness again ‘nothing have they done sir’ said the woman pointing to her boys ‘for six and twenty weeks and all our money gone – all the twenty pounds that me and father saved when times were better thinking it would yield a little to keep us when we got past work look at it’ she said almost fiercely bringing out a bankbook with all its well kept entries of money paid in and money taken out so that we could see how the little fortune had begun with the first five shilling deposit and had grown by little and little to be twenty pounds and how it had melted down again till the sum in hand got from pounds to shillings and the last entry made the book as worthless as a blank sheet this family received relief from the workhouse and it furnished them with just one scanty meal per day our next visit was to an iron labourer’s wife whose husband had worked in the yards we found her ill from want of food lying on a mattress in her clothes and just covered with a strip of carpet for all the bedding had been pawned two wretched children were tending her themselves looking as much in need of nursing as their mother nineteen weeks of enforced idleness had brought them to this pass and while the mother told the history of that bitter past she moaned as if all her faith in a future that should atone for it were dead on getting outside a young fellow came running after us and asked us to step inside his house and see if anything could be done for him a young wife two pretty children a cluster of pawntickets and a bare room were all he had to show” on the after pains of the crisis of the following extract from a tory newspaper it must not be forgotten that the eastend of london which is here dealt with is not only the seat of the iron shipbuilding mentioned above but also of a socalled “homeindustry” always underpaid “a frightful spectacle was to be seen yesterday in one part of the metropolis although the unemployed thousands of the eastend did not parade with their black flags en masse the human torrent was imposing enough let us remember what these people suffer they are dying of hunger that is the simple and terrible fact there are of them in our presence in one quarter of this wonderful metropolis are packed – next door to the most enormous accumulation of wealth the world ever saw – cheek by jowl with this are helpless starving people these thousands are now breaking in upon the other quarters always halfstarving they cry their misery in our ears they cry to heaven they tell us from their miserable dwellings that it is impossible for them to find work and useless for them to beg the local ratepayers themselves are driven by the parochial charges to the verge of pauperism” – standard th april as it is the fashion amongst english capitalists to quote belgium as the paradise of the labourer because “freedom of labour” or what is the same thing “freedom of capital” is there limited neither by the despotism of trades’ unions nor by factory acts a word or two on the “happiness” of the belgian labourer assuredly no one was more thoroughly initiated in the mysteries of this happiness than the late m ducpétiaux inspectorgeneral of belgian prisons and charitable institutions and member of the central commission of belgian statistics let us take his work “budgets économiques des classes ouvrières de la belgique” bruxelles here we find among other matters a normal belgian labourer’s family whose yearly income and expenditure he calculates on very exact data and whose conditions of nourishment are then compared with those of the soldier sailor and prisoner the family “consists of father mother and four children” of these persons “four may be usefully employed the whole year through” it is assumed that “there is no sick person nor one incapable of work among them” nor are there “expenses for religious moral and intellectual purposes except a very small sum for church sittings” nor “contributions to savings banks or benefit societies” nor “expenses due to luxury or the result of improvidence” the father and eldest son however allow themselves “the use of tobacco” and on sundays “go to the cabaret” for which a whole centimes a week are reckoned “from a general compilation of wages allowed to the labourers in different trades it follows that the highest average of daily wage is franc c for men centimes for women centimes for boys and centimes for girls calculated at this rate the resources of the family would amount at the maximum to francs ayear in the family taken as typical we have calculated all possible resources but in ascribing wages to the mother of the family we raise the question of the direction of the household how will its internal economy be cared for who will look after the young children who will get ready the meals do the washing and mending this is the dilemma incessantly presented to the labourers” according to this the budget of the family is the father working days at fr fr mother working days at fr fr boy working days at fr fr girl working days at fr fr total fr the annual expenditure of the family would cause a deficit upon the hypothesis that the labourer has the food of the manofwar’s man fr deficit fr the soldier fr deficit fr the prisoner fr deficit fr “we see that few labouring families can reach we will not say the average of the sailor or soldier but even that of the prisoner the general average of the cost of each prisoner in the different prisons during the period has been centimes for all prisons this figure compared with that of the daily maintenance of the labourer shows a difference of centimes it must be remarked further that if in the prisons it is necessary to set down in the account the expenses of administration and surveillance on the other hand the prisoners have not to pay for their lodging that the purchases they make at the canteens are not included in the expenses of maintenance and that these expenses are greatly lowered in consequence of the large number of persons that make up the establishments and of contracting for or buying wholesale the food and other things that enter into their consumption how comes it however that a great number we might say a great majority of labourers live in a more economical way it is by adopting expedients the secret of which only the labourer knows by reducing his daily rations by substituting ryebread for wheat by eating less meat or even none at all and the same with butter and condiments by contenting themselves with one or two rooms where the family is crammed together where boys and girls sleep side by side often on the same pallet by economy of clothing washing decency by giving up the sunday diversions by in short resigning themselves to the most painful privations once arrived at this extreme limit the least rise in the price of food stoppage of work illness increases the labourer’s distress and determines his complete ruin debts accumulate credit fails the most necessary clothes and furniture are pawned and finally the family asks to be enrolled on the list of paupers” ducpétiaux l c pp in fact in this “paradise of capitalists” there follows on the smallest change in the price of the most essential means of subsistence a change in the number of deaths and crimes see manifesto of the maatschappij “de vlamingen vooruit” brussels pp in all belgium are families of whom according to the official statistics are wealthy and on the list of voters persons families of the lower middleclass in towns and villages the greater part of them constantly sinking into the proletariat persons finally working class families persons of whom the model ones enjoy the happiness depicted by ducpétiaux of the working class families over are on the pauper list e the british agricultural proletariat nowhere does the antagonistic character of capitalistic production and accumulation assert itself more brutally than in the progress of english agriculture including cattlebreeding and the retrogression of the english agricultural labourer before i turn to his present situation a rapid retrospect modern agriculture dates in england from the middle of the th century although the revolution in landed property from which the changed mode of production starts as a basis has a much earlier date if we take the statements of arthur young a careful observer though a superficial thinker as to the agricultural labourer of the latter plays a very pitiable part compared with his predecessor of the end of the th century “when the labourer could live in plenty and accumulate wealth” not to speak of the th century “the golden age of the english labourer in town and country” we need not however go back so far in a very instructive work of the year we read “the great farmer is nearly mounted to a level with him the gentleman while the poor labourer is depressed almost to the earth his unfortunate situation will fully appear by taking a comparative view of it only forty years ago and at present landlord and tenant have both gone hand in hand in keeping the labourer down” it is then proved in detail that the real agricultural wages between and fell nearly ¼ or per cent “modern policy” says dr richard price also “is indeed more favourable to the higher classes of people and the consequences may in time prove that the whole kingdom will consist of only gentry and beggars or of grandees and slaves” nevertheless the position of the english agricultural labourer from to with regard to his food and dwelling as well as to his selfrespect amusements c is an ideal never attained again since that time his average wage expressed in pints of wheat was from to pints in eden’s time only in but the state of the agricultural labourer at the end of the antijacobin war during which landed proprietors farmers manufacturers merchants bankers stockbrokers armycontractors c enriched themselves so extraordinarily has been already indicated above the nominal wages rose in consequence partly of the banknote depreciation partly of a rise in the price of the primary means of subsistence independent of this depreciation but the actual wagevariation can be evidenced in a very simple way without entering into details that are here unnecessary the poor law and its administration were in and the same it will be remembered how this law was carried out in the country districts in the form of alms the parish made up the nominal wage to the nominal sum required for the simple vegetation of the labourer the ratio between the wages paid by the farmer and the wagedeficit made good by the parish shows us two things first the falling of wages below their minimum second the degree in which the agricultural labourer was a compound of wage labourer and pauper or the degree in which he had been turned into a serf of his parish let us take one county that represents the average condition of things in all counties in northamptonshire in the average weekly wage was s d the total yearly expenditure of a family of persons £ s d their total income £ s deficit made good by the parish £ s d in in the same county the weekly wage was s d the total yearly expenditure of a family of persons £ s d their total income £ s deficit made good by the parish £ s d in the deficit was less than the wage in more than half it is selfevident that under these circumstances the meagre comforts that eden still found in the cottage of the agricultural labourer had vanished by of all the animals kept by the farmer the labourer the instrumentum vocale was thenceforth the most oppressed the worst nourished the most brutally treated the same state of things went on quietly until “the swing riots in revealed to us ie the ruling classes by the light of blazing cornstacks that misery and black mutinous discontent smouldered quite as fiercely under the surface of agricultural as of manufacturing england” at this time sadler in the house of commons christened the agricultural labourers “white slaves” and a bishop echoed the epithet in the upper house the most notable political economist of that period – e g wakefield – says “the peasant of the south of england is not a freeman nor is he a slave he is a pauper” the time just before the repeal of the corn laws threw new light on the condition of the agricultural labourers on the one hand it was to the interest of the middleclass agitators to prove how little the corn laws protected the actual producers of the corn on the other hand the industrial bourgeoisie foamed with sullen rage at the denunciations of the factory system by the landed aristocracy at the pretended sympathy with the woes of the factory operatives of those utterly corrupt heartless and genteel loafers and at their “diplomatic zeal” for factory legislation it is an old english proverb that “when thieves fall out honest men come by their own” and in fact the noisy passionate quarrel between the two fractions of the ruling class about the question which of the two exploited the labourers the more shamefully was on each hand the midwife of the truth earl shaftesbury then lord ashley was commanderinchief in the aristocratic philanthropic antifactory campaign he was therefore in a favourite subject in the revelations of the morning chronicle on the condition of the agricultural labourers this journal then the most important liberal organ sent special commissioners into the agricultural districts who did not content themselves with mere general descriptions and statistics but published the names both of the labouring families examined and of their landlords the following list gives the wages paid in three villages in the neighbourhood of blanford wimbourne and poole the villages are the property of mr g bankes and of the earl of shaftesbury it will be noted that just like bankes this “low church pope” this head of english pietists pockets a great part of the miserable wages of the labourers under the pretext of

s d the repeal of the corn laws gave a marvellous impulse to english agriculture drainage on the most extensive scale new methods of stallfeeding and of the artificial cultivation of green crops introduction of mechanical manuring apparatus new treatment of clay soils increased use of mineral manures employment of the steamengine and of all kinds of new machinery more intensive cultivation generally characterised this epoch mr pusey chairman of the royal agricultural society declares that the relative expenses of farming have been reduced nearly one half by the introduction of new machinery on the other hand the actual return of the soil rose rapidly greater outlay of capital per acre and as a consequence more rapid concentration of farms were essential conditions of the new method at the same time the area under cultivation increased from to by acres without reckoning the great area in the eastern counties which was transformed from rabbit warrens and poor pastures into magnificent cornfields it has already been seen that at the same time the total number of persons employed in agriculture fell as far as the actual agricultural labourers of both sexes and of all ages are concerned their number fell from in to in if the english registrargeneral therefore rightly remarks “the increase of farmers and farmlabourers since bears no kind of proportion to the increase of agricultural produce” this disproportion obtains much more for the last period when a positive decrease of the agricultural population went hand in hand with increase of the area under cultivation with more intensive cultivation unheardof accumulation of the capital incorporated with the soil and devoted to its working an augmentation in the products of the soil without parallel in the history of english agriculture plethoric rentrolls of landlords and growing wealth of the capitalist farmers if we take this together with the swift unbroken extension of the markets viz the towns and the reign of free trade then the agricultural labourer was at last post tot discrimina rerum placed in circumstances that ought secundum artem to have made him drunk with happiness but professor rogers comes to the conclusion that the lot of the english agricultural labourer of today not to speak of his predecessor in the last half of the th and in the th century but only compared with his predecessor from to has changed for the worse to an extraordinary extent that “the peasant has again become a serf” and a serf worse fed and worse clothed dr julian hunter in his epoch making report on the dwellings of the agricultural labourers says “the cost of the hind” a name for the agricultural labourer inherited from the time of serfdom “is fixed at the lowest possible amount on which he can live the supplies of wages and shelter are not calculated on the profit to be derived from him he is a zero in farming calculations the means of subsistence being always supposed to be a fixed quantity as to any further reduction of his income he may say nihil habeo nihil curo he has no fears for the future because he has now only the spare supply necessary to keep him he has reached the zero from which are dated the calculations of the farmer come what will he has no share either in prosperity or adversity” in the year an official inquiry took place into the conditions of nourishment and labour of the criminals condemned to transportation and penal servitude the results are recorded in two voluminous blue books among other things it is said “from an elaborate comparison between the diet of convicts in the convict prisons in england and that of paupers in workhouses and of free labourers in the same country it certainly appears that the former are much better fed than either of the two other classes” whilst “the amount of labour required from an ordinary convict under penal servitude is about one half of what would be done by an ordinary daylabourer” a few characteristic depositions of witnesses john smith governor of the edinburgh prison deposes no “the diet of the english prisons is superior to that of ordinary labourers in england” no “it is the fact that the ordinary agricultural labourers in scotland very seldom get any meat at all” answer no “is there anything that you are aware of to account for the necessity of feeding them very much better than ordinary labourers – certainly not” no “do you think that further experiments ought to be made in order to ascertain whether a dietary might not be hit upon for prisoners employed on public works nearly approaching to the dietary of free labourers ” “he the agricultural labourer might say ‘i work hard and have not enough to eat and when in prison i did not work harder where i had plenty to eat and therefore it is better for me to be in prison again than here’” from the tables appended to the first volume of the report i have compiled the annexed comparative summary weekly amount of nutrients quantity of nitrogenous ingredients quantity of nonnitro genous in gredients quantity of mineral matter total ounces ounces ounces ounces portland convict sailor in the navy soldier working coachmaker compositor agricultural labourer the general result of the inquiry by the medical commission of on the food of the lowest fed classes is already known to the reader he will remember that the diet of a great part of the agricultural labourers’ families is below the minimum necessary “to arrest starvation diseases” this is especially the case in all the purely rural districts of cornwall devon somerset wilts stafford oxford berks and herts “the nourishment obtained by the labourer himself” says dr e smith “is larger than the average quantity indicates since he eats a larger share necessary to enable him to perform his labour of food than the other members of the family including in the poorer districts nearly all the meat and bacon the quantity of food obtained by the wife and also by the children at the period of rapid growth is in many cases in almost every county deficient and particularly in nitrogen” the male and female servants living with the farmers themselves are sufficiently nourished their number fell from in to in “the labour of women in the fields” says dr smith “whatever may be its disadvantages is under present circumstances of great advantage to the family since it adds that amount of income which provides shoes and clothing and pays the rent and thus enables the family to be better fed” one of the most remarkable results of the inquiry was that the agricultural labourer of england as compared with other parts of the united kingdom “is considerably the worst fed” as the appended table shows quantities of carbon and nitrogen weekly consumed by an average agricultural adult carbon grains nitrogen grains england wales scotland ireland “to the insufficient quantity and miserable quality of the house accommodation generally had” says dr simon in his official health report “by our agricultural labourers almost every page of dr hunter’s report bears testimony and gradually for many years past the state of the labourer in these respects has been deteriorating houseroom being now greatly more difficult for him to find and when found greatly less suitable to his needs than perhaps for centuries had been the case especially within the last twenty or thirty years the evil has been in very rapid increase and the household circumstances of the labourer are now in the highest degree deplorable except in so far as they whom his labour enriches see fit to treat him with a kind of pitiful indulgence he is quite peculiarly helpless in the matter whether he shall find houseroom on the land which he contributes to till whether the houseroom which he gets shall be human or swinish whether he shall have the little space of garden that so vastly lessens the pressure of his poverty – all this does not depend on his willingness and ability to pay reasonable rent for the decent accommodation he requires but depends on the use which others may see fit to make of their ‘right to do as they will with their own’ however large may be a farm there is no law that a certain proportion of labourers’ dwellings much less of decent dwellings shall be upon it nor does any law reserve for the labourer ever so little right in that soil to which his industry is as needful as sun and rain an extraneous element weighs the balance heavily against him the influence of the poor law in its provisions concerning settlement and chargeability under this influence each parish has a pecuniary interest in reducing to a minimum the number of its resident labourers – for unhappily agricultural labour instead of implying a safe and permanent independence for the hardworking labourer and his family implies for the most part only a longer or shorter circuit to eventual pauperism – a pauperism which during the whole circuit is so near that any illness or temporary failure of occupation necessitates immediate recourse to parochial relief – and thus all residence of agricultural population in a parish is glaringly an addition to its poorrates large proprietors have but to resolve that there shall be no labourers’ dwellings on their estates and their estates will thenceforth be virtually free from half their responsibility for the poor how far it has been intended in the english constitution and law that this kind of unconditional property in land should be acquirable and that a landlord ‘doing as he wills with his own’ should be able to treat the cultivators of the soil as aliens whom he may expel from his territory is a question which i do not pretend to discuss for that power of eviction does not exist only in theory on a very large scale it prevails in practice – prevails as a main governing condition in the household circumstances of agricultural labour as regards the extent of the evil it may suffice to refer to the evidence which dr hunter has compiled from the last census that destruction of houses notwithstanding increased local demands for them had during the last ten years been in progress in separate parishes or townships of england so that irrespectively of persons who had been forced to become nonresident that is in the parishes in which they work these parishes and townships were receiving in as compared with a population per cent greater into houseroom ½ per cent less when the process of depopulation has completed itself the result says dr hunter is a showvillage where the cottages have been reduced to a few and where none but persons who are needed as shepherds gardeners or gamekeepers are allowed to live regular servants who receive the good treatment usual to their class but the land requires cultivation and it will be found that the labourers employed upon it are not the tenants of the owner but that they come from a neighbouring open village perhaps three miles off where a numerous small proprietary had received them when their cottages were destroyed in the close villages around where things are tending to the above result often the cottages which stand testify in their unrepaired and wretched condition to the extinction to which they are doomed they are seen standing in the various stages of natural decay while the shelter holds together the labourer is permitted to rent it and glad enough he will often be to do so even at the price of decent lodging but no repair no improvement shall it receive except such as its penniless occupants can supply and when at last it becomes quite uninhabitable – uninhabitable even to the humblest standard of serfdom – it will be but one more destroyed cottage and future poorrates will be somewhat lightened while great owners are thus escaping from poorrates through the depopulation of lands over which they have control the nearest town or open village receive the evicted labourers the nearest i say but this “nearest” may mean three or four miles distant from the farm where the labourer has his daily toil to that daily toil there will then have to be added as though it were nothing the daily need of walking six or eight miles for power of earning his bread and whatever farm work is done by his wife and children is done at the same disadvantage nor is this nearly all the toil which the distance occasions him in the open village cottagespeculators buy scraps of land which they throng as densely as they can with the cheapest of all possible hovels and into those wretched habitations which even if they adjoin the open country have some of the worst features of the worst town residences crowd the agricultural labourers of england nor on the other hand must it be supposed that even when the labourer is housed upon the lands which he cultivates his household circumstances are generally such as his life of productive industry would seem to deserve even on princely estates his cottage may be of the meanest description there are landlords who deem any stye good enough for their labourer and his family and who yet do not disdain to drive with him the hardest possible bargain for rent it may be but a ruinous onebedroomed hut having no firegrate no privy no opening window no water supply but the ditch no garden – but the labourer is helpless against the wrong and the nuisances removal acts are a mere dead letter in great part dependent for their working on such cottageowners as the one from whom his the labourer’s hovel is rented from brighter but exceptional scenes it is requisite in the interests of justice that attention should again be drawn to the overwhelming preponderance of facts which are a reproach to the civilisation of england lamentable indeed must be the case when notwithstanding all that is evident with regard to the quality of the present accommodation it is the common conclusion of competent observers that even the general badness of dwellings is an evil infinitely less urgent than their mere numerical insufficiency for years the overcrowding of rural labourers’ dwellings has been a matter of deep concern not only to persons who care for sanitary good but to persons who care for decent and moral life for again and again in phrases so uniform that they seem stereotyped reporters on the spread of epidemic disease in rural districts have insisted on the extreme importance of that overcrowding as an influence which renders it a quite hopeless task to attempt the limiting of any infection which is introduced and again and again it has been pointed out that notwithstanding the many salubrious influences which there are in country life the crowding which so favours the extension of contagious disease also favours the origination of disease which is not contagious and those who have denounced the overcrowded state of our rural population have not been silent as to a further mischief even where their primary concern has been only with the injury to health often almost perforce they have referred to other relations on the subject in showing how frequently it happens that adult persons of both sexes married and unmarried are huddled together in single small sleeping rooms their reports have carried the conviction that under the circumstances they describe decency must always be outraged and morality almost of necessity must suffer thus for instance in the appendix of my last annual report dr ord reporting on an outbreak of fever at wing in buckinghamshire mentions how a young man who had come thither from wingrave with fever “in the first days of his illness slept in a room with nine other persons within a fortnight several of these persons were attacked and in the course of a few weeks five out of the nine had fever and one died” from dr harvey of st george’s hospital who on private professional business visited wing during the time of the epidemic i received information exactly in the sense of the above report “a young woman having fever lay at night in a room occupied by her father and mother her bastard child two young men her brothers and her two sisters each with a bastard child – persons in all a few weeks ago persons slept in it” dr hunter investigated cottages of agricultural labourers not only in the purely agricultural districts but in all counties of england of these had only one bedroom often at the same time used as livingroom only two and more than two i will give a few specimens culled from a dozen counties bedfordshire

some of the farmers declare that the cots are “a great nuisance here because they bring the poor” on the statement of one gentleman “the poor are none the better for them if you build they will let fast enough in fact the more you build the more they want” according to him the houses give birth to the inhabitants who then by a law of nature press on “the means of housing” dr hunter remarks “now these poor must come from somewhere and as there is no particular attraction such as doles at badsey it must be repulsion from some other unfit place which will send them here if each could find an allotment near his work he would not prefer badsey where he pays for his scrap of ground twice as much as the farmer pays for his” the continual emigration to the towns the continual formation of surplus population in the country through the concentration of farms conversion of arable land into pasture machinery c and the continual eviction of the agricultural population by the destruction of their cottages go hand in hand the more empty the district is of men the greater is its “relative surplus population” the greater is their pressure on the means of employment the greater is the absolute excess of the agricultural population over the means for housing it the greater therefore in the villages is the local surplus population and the most pestilential packing together of human beings the packing together of knots of men in scattered little villages and small country towns corresponds to the forcible draining of men from the surface of the land the continuous superseding of the agricultural labourers in spite of their diminishing number and the increasing mass of their products gives birth to their pauperism their pauperism is ultimately a motive to their eviction and the chief source of their miserable housing which breaks down their last power of resistance and makes them more slaves of the landed proprietors and the farmers thus the minimum of wages becomes a law of nature to them on the other hand the land in spite of its constant “relative surplus population” is at the same time underpopulated this is seen not only locally at the points where the efflux of men to towns mines railroadmaking c is most marked it is to be seen everywhere in harvesttime as well as in spring and summer at those frequently recurring times when english agriculture so careful and intensive wants extra hands there are always too many agricultural labourers for the ordinary and always too few for the exceptional or temporary needs of the cultivation of the soil hence we find in the official documents contradictory complaints from the same places of deficiency and excess of labour simultaneously the temporary or local want of labour brings about no rise in wages but a forcing of the women and children into the fields and exploitation at an age constantly lowered as soon as the exploitation of the women and children takes place on a larger scale it becomes in turn a new means of making a surplus population of the male agricultural labourer and of keeping down his wage in the east of england thrives a beautiful fruit of this vicious circle – the socalled gangsystem to which i must briefly return here the gangsystem obtains almost exclusively in the counties of lincoln huntingdon cambridge norfolk suffolk and nottingham here and there in the neighbouring counties of northampton bedford and rutland lincolnshire will serve us as an example a large part of this county is new land marsh formerly or even as in others of the eastern counties just named won lately from the sea the steamengine has worked wonders in the way of drainage what were once fens and sandbanks bear now a luxuriant sea of corn and the highest of rents the same thing holds of the alluvial lands won by human endeavour as in the island of axholme and other parishes on the banks of the trent in proportion as the new farms arose not only were no new cottages built old ones were demolished and the supply of labour had to come from open villages miles away by long roads that wound along the sides of the hills there alone had the population formerly found shelter from the incessant floods of the wintertime the labourers that dwell on the farms of acres they are called “confined labourers” are solely employed on such kinds of agricultural work as is permanent difficult and carried on by aid of horses for every acres there is on an average scarcely one cottage a fen farmer eg gave evidence before the commission of inquiry “i farm acres all arable land i have not one cottage on my farm i have only one labourer on my farm now i have four horsemen lodging about we get light work done by gangs” the soil requires much light field labour such as weeding hoeing certain processes of manuring removing of stones c this is done by the gangs or organised bands that dwell in the open villages the gang consists of to or persons women young persons of both sexes years of age although the boys are for the most part eliminated at the age of and children of both sexes years of age at the head is the gang master always an ordinary agricultural labourer generally what is called a bad lot a scapegrace unsteady drunken but with a dash of enterprise and savoirfaire he is the recruitingsergeant for the gang which works under him not under the farmer he generally arranges with the latter for piecework and his income which on the average is not very much above that of an ordinary agricultural labourer depends almost entirely upon the dexterity with which he manages to extract within the shortest time the greatest possible amount of labour from his gang the farmers have discovered that women work steadily only under the direction of men but that women and children once set going impetuously spend their lifeforce – as fourier knew – while the adult male labourer is shrewd enough to economise his as much as he can the gangmaster goes from one farm to another and thus employs his gang from to months in the year employment by him is therefore much more lucrative and more certain for the labouring families than employment by the individual farmer who only employs children occasionally this circumstance so completely rivets his influence in the open villages that children are generally only to be hired through his instrumentality the lending out of these individually independently of the gang is his second trade the “drawbacks” of the system are the overwork of the children and young persons the enormous marches that they make daily to and from the farms and sometimes miles distant finally the demoralisation of the gang although the gangmaster who in some districts is called “the driver” is armed with a long stick he uses it but seldom and complaints of brutal treatment are exceptional he is a democratic emperor or a kind of pied piper of hamelin he must therefore be popular with his subjects and he binds them to himself by the charms of the gipsy life under his direction coarse freedom a noisy jollity and obscenest impudence give attractions to the gang generally the gangmaster pays up in a public house then he returns home at the head of the procession reeling drunk propped up right and left by a stalwart virago while children and young persons bring up the rear boisterous and singing chaffing and bawdy songs on the return journey what fourier calls “phanerogamie” is the order of the day the getting with child of girls of and by their male companions of the same age is common the open villages which supply the contingent of the gang become sodoms and gomorrahs and have twice as high a rate of illegitimate births as the rest of the kingdom the moral character of girls bred in these schools when married women was shown above their children when opium does not give them the finishing stroke are born recruits of the gang the gang in its classical form just described is called the public common or tramping gang for there are also private gangs these are made up in the same way as the common gang but count fewer members and work not under a gangmaster but under some old farm servant whom the farmer does not know how to employ in any better way the gipsy fun has vanished here but according to all witnesses the payment and treatment of the children is worse the gangsystem which during the last years has steadily increased clearly does not exist for the sake of the gangmaster it exists for the enrichment of the large farmers and indirectly of the landlords for the farmer there is no more ingenious method of keeping his labourers well below the normal level and yet of always having an extra hand ready for extra work of extracting the greatest possible amount of labour with the least possible amount of money and of making adult male labour “redundant” from the exposition already made it will be understood why on the one hand a greater or less lack of employment for the agricultural labourer is admitted while on the other the gangsystem is at the same time declared “necessary” on account of the want of adult male labour and its migration to the towns the cleanly weeded land and the uncleanly human weeds of lincolnshire are pole and counterpole of capitalistic production f ireland in concluding this section we must travel for a moment to ireland first the main facts of the case the population of ireland had in reached in it had dwindled to in to in to ½ millions nearly to its level in the diminution began with the famine year so that ireland in less than twenty years lost more than ths of its people its total emigration from may to july numbered the emigration during the years was more than halfamillion the number of inhabited houses fell from by from the number of holdings of to acres increased that of holdings over acres whilst the total number of all farms fell a fall therefore solely due to the suppression of farms under acres – ie to their centralisation table a livestock year horses cattle sheep pigs total number decrease total number decrease increase total number decrease increase total number decrease increase – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – the decrease of the population was naturally accompanied by a decrease in the mass of products for our purpose it suffices to consider the years from during which over halfamillion emigrated and the absolute number of people sank by more than of a million from the above table it results – horses cattle sheep pigs absolute decrease absolute decrease absolute increase absolute increase let us now turn to agriculture which yields the means of subsistence for cattle and for men in the following table is calculated the decrease or increase for each separate year as

england a country with fully developed capitalist production and preeminently industrial would have bled to death with such a drain of population as ireland has suffered but ireland is at present only an agricultural district of england marked off by a wide channel from the country to which it yields corn wool cattle industrial and military recruits the depopulation of ireland has thrown much of the land out of cultivation has greatly diminished the produce of the soil and in spite of the greater area devoted to cattle breeding has brought about in some of its branches an absolute diminution in others an advance scarcely worthy of mention and constantly interrupted by retrogressions nevertheless with the fall in numbers of the population rents and farmers’ profits rose although the latter not as steadily as the former the reason of this is easily comprehensible on the one hand with the throwing of small holdings into large ones and the change of arable into pasture land a larger part of the whole produce was transformed into surplusproduce the surplusproduce increased although the total produce of which it formed a fraction decreased on the other hand the money value of this surplusproduce increased yet more rapidly than its mass in consequence of the rise in the english market price of meat wool c during the last and especially during the last years the scattered means of production that serve the producers themselves as means of employment and of subsistence without expanding their own value by the incorporation of the labour of others are no more capital than a product consumed by its own producer is a commodity if with the mass of the population that of the means of production employed in agriculture also diminished the mass of the capital employed in agriculture increased because a part of the means of production that were formerly scattered was concentrated and turned into capital the total capital of ireland outside agriculture employed in industry and trade accumulated during the last two decades slowly and with great and constantly recurring fluctuations so much the more rapidly did the concentration of its individual constituents develop and however small its absolute increase in proportion to the dwindling population it had increased largely here then under our own eyes and on a large scale a process is revealed than which nothing more excellent could be wished for by orthodox economy for the support of its dogma that misery springs from absolute surplus population and that equilibrium is reestablished by depopulation this is a far more important experiment than was the plague in the middle of the th century so belauded of malthusians note further if only the naïveté of the schoolmaster could apply to the conditions of production and population of the nineteenth century the standard of the th this naïveté into the bargain overlooked the fact that whilst after the plague and the decimation that accompanied it followed on this side of the channel in england enfranchisement and enrichment of the agricultural population on that side in france followed greater servitude and more misery the irish famine of killed more than people but it killed poor devils only to the wealth of the country it did not the slightest damage the exodus of the next years an exodus still constantly increasing did not as eg the thirty years’ war decimate along with the human beings their means of production irish genius discovered an altogether new way of spiriting a poor people thousands of miles away from the scene of its misery the exiles transplanted to the united states send home sums of money every year as travelling expenses for those left behind every troop that emigrates one year draws another after it the next thus instead of costing ireland anything emigration forms one of the most lucrative branches of its export trade finally it is a systematic process which does not simply make a passing gap in the population but sucks out of it every year more people than are replaced by the births so that the absolute level of the population falls year by year what were the consequences for the irish labourers left behind and freed from the surplus population that the relative surplus population is today as great as before that wages are just as low that the oppression of the labourers has increased that misery is forcing the country towards a new crisis the facts are simple the revolution in agriculture has kept pace with emigration the production of relative surplus population has more than kept pace with the absolute depopulation a glance at table c shows that the change of arable to pasture land must work yet more acutely in ireland than in england in england the cultivation of green crops increases with the breeding of cattle in ireland it decreases whilst a large number of acres that were formerly tilled lie idle or are turned permanently into grassland a great part of the waste land and peat bogs that were unused formerly become of service for the extension of cattlebreeding the smaller and medium farmers – i reckon among these all who do not cultivate more than acres – still make up about ths of the whole number they are one after the other and with a degree of force unknown before crushed by the competition of an agriculture managed by capital and therefore they continually furnish new recruits to the class of wage labourers the one great industry of ireland linenmanufacture requires relatively few adult men and only employs altogether in spite of its expansion since the price of cotton rose in a comparatively insignificant part of the population like all other great modern industries it constantly produces by incessant fluctuations a relative surplus population within its own sphere even with an absolute increase in the mass of human beings absorbed by it the misery of the agricultural population forms the pedestal for gigantic shirtfactories whose armies of labourers are for the most part scattered over the country here we encounter again the system described above of domestic industry which in underpayment and overwork possesses its own systematic means for creating supernumerary labourers finally although the depopulation has not such destructive consequences as would result in a country with fully developed capitalistic production it does not go on without constant reaction upon the homemarket the gap which emigration causes here limits not only the local demand for labour but also the incomes of small shopkeepers artisans tradespeople generally hence the diminution in incomes between £ and £ in table e a clear statement of the condition of the agricultural labourers in ireland is to be found in the reports of the irish poor law inspectors officials of a government which is maintained only by bayonets and by a state of siege now open now disguised they have to observe all the precautions of language that their colleagues in england disdain in spite of this however they do not let their government cradle itself in illusions according to them the rate of wages in the country still very low has within the last years risen per cent and stands now on the average at s to s per week but behind this apparent rise is hidden an actual fall in wages for it does not correspond at all to the rise in price of the necessary means of subsistence that has taken place in the meantime for proof the following extract from the official accounts of an irish workhouse average weekly cost per head year ended provisions and necessaries clothing total th sept s d d s d th sept s d d s d the price of the necessary means of subsistence is therefore fully twice and that of clothing exactly twice as much as they were years before even apart from this disproportion the mere comparison of the rate of wages expressed in gold would give a result far from accurate before the famine the great mass of agricultural wages were paid in kind only the smallest part in money today payment in money is the rule from this it follows that whatever the amount of the real wage its money rate must rise “previous to the famine the labourer enjoyed his cabin with a rood or halfacre or acre of land and facilities for a crop of potatoes he was able to rear his pig and keep fowl but they now have to buy bread and they have no refuse upon which they can feed a pig or fowl and they have consequently no benefit from the sale of a pig fowl or eggs” in fact formerly the agricultural labourers were but the smallest of the small farmers and formed for the most part a kind of rearguard of the medium and large farms on which they found employment only since the catastrophe of have they begun to form a fraction of the class of purely wage labourers a special class connected with its wagemasters only by monetary relations we know what were the conditions of their dwellings in since then they have grown yet worse a part of the agricultural labourers which however grows less day by day dwells still on the holdings of the farmers in overcrowded huts whose hideousness far surpasses the worst that the english agricultural labourers offered us in this way and this holds generally with the exception of certain tracts of ulster in the south in the counties of cork limerick kilkenny c in the east in wicklow wexford c in the centre of ireland in king’s and queen’s county dublin c in the west in sligo roscommon mayo galway c “the agricultural labourers’ huts” an inspector cries out “are a disgrace to the christianity and to the civilisation of this country” in order to increase the attractions of these holes for the labourers the pieces of land belonging thereto from time immemorial are systematically confiscated “the mere sense that they exist subject to this species of ban on the part of the landlords and their agents has given birth in the minds of the labourers to corresponding sentiments of antagonism and dissatisfaction towards those by whom they are thus led to regard themselves as being treated as a proscribed race” the first act of the agricultural revolution was to sweep away the huts situated on the field of labour this was done on the largest scale and as if in obedience to a command from on high thus many labourers were compelled to seek shelter in villages and towns there they were thrown like refuse into garrets holes cellars and corners in the worst back slums thousands of irish families who according to the testimony of the english eaten up as these are with national prejudice are notable for their rare attachment to the domestic hearth for their gaiety and the purity of their homelife found themselves suddenly transplanted into hotbeds of vice the men are now obliged to seek work of the neighbouring farmers and are only hired by the day and therefore under the most precarious form of wage hence “they sometimes have long distances to go to and from work often get wet and suffer much hardship not unfrequently ending in sickness disease and want” “ the towns have had to receive from year to year what was deemed to be the surplus labour of the rural division” and then people still wonder “there is still a surplus of labour in the towns and villages and either a scarcity or a threatened scarcity in some of the country divisions” the truth is that this want only becomes perceptible “in harvesttime or during spring or at such times as agricultural operations are carried on with activity at other periods of the year many hands are idle” that “from the digging out of the main crop of potatoes in october until the early spring following there is no employment for them” and further that during the active times they “are subject to broken days and to all kinds of interruptions” these results of the agricultural revolution – ie the change of arable into pasture land the use of machinery the most rigorous economy of labour c are still further aggravated by the model landlords who instead of spending their rents in other countries condescend to live in ireland on their demesnes in order that the law of supply and demand may not be broken these gentlemen draw their “laboursupply chiefly from their small tenants who are obliged to attend when required to do the landlord’s work at rates of wages in many instances considerably under the current rates paid to ordinary labourers and without regard to the inconvenience or loss to the tenant of being obliged to neglect his own business at critical periods of sowing or reaping” the uncertainty and irregularity of employment the constant return and long duration of gluts of labour all these symptoms of a relative surplus population figure therefore in the reports of the poor law administration as so many hardships of the agricultural proletariat it will be remembered that we met in the english agricultural proletariat with a similar spectacle but the difference is that in england an industrial country the industrial reserve recruits itself from the country districts whilst in ireland an agricultural country the agricultural reserve recruits itself from the towns the cities of refuge of the expelled agricultural labourers in the former the supernumeraries of agriculture are transformed into factory operatives in the latter those forced into the towns whilst at the same time they press on the wages in towns remain agricultural labourers and are constantly sent back to the country districts in search of work the official inspectors sum up the material condition of the agricultural labourer as follows “though living with the strictest frugality his own wages are barely sufficient to provide food for an ordinary family and pay his rent” and he depends upon other sources for the means of clothing himself his wife and children the atmosphere of these cabins combined with the other privations they are subjected to has made this class particularly susceptible to low fever and pulmonary consumption” after this it is no wonder that according to the unanimous testimony of the inspectors a sombre discontent runs through the ranks of this class that they long for the return of the past loathe the present despair of the future give themselves up “to the evil influence of agitators” and have only one fixed idea to emigrate to america this is the land of cockaigne into which the great malthusian panacea depopulation has transformed green erin what a happy life the irish factory operative leads one example will show “on my recent visit to the north of ireland” says the english factory inspector robert baker “i met with the following evidence of effort in an irish skilled workman to afford education to his children and i give his evidence verbatim as i took it from his mouth that he was a skilled factory hand may be understood when i say that he was employed on goods for the manchester market ‘johnson – i am a beetler and work from in the morning till at night from monday to friday saturday we leave off at p m and get three hours of it for meals and rest i have five children in all for this work i get s d a week my wife works here also and gets s a week the oldest girl who is minds the house she is also cook and all the servant we have she gets the young ones ready for school a girl going past the house wakes me at half past five in the morning my wife gets up and goes along with me we get nothing to eat before we come to work the child of takes care of the little children all the day and we get nothing till breakfast at eight at eight we go home we get tea once a week at other times we get stirabout sometimes of oatmeal sometimes of indian meal as we are able to get it in the winter we get a little sugar and water to our indian meal in the summer we get a few potatoes planting a small patch ourselves and when they are done we get back to stirabout sometimes we get a little milk as it may be so we go on from day to day sunday and week day always the same the year round i am always very much tired when i have done at night we may see a bit of flesh meat sometimes but very seldom three of our children attend school for whom we pay d a week a head our rent is d a week peat for firing costs s d a fortnight at the very lowest’” such are irish wages such is irish life in fact the misery of ireland is again the topic of the day in england at the end of and the beginning of one of the irish land magnates lord dufferin set about its solution in the times “wie menschlich von solch grossem herrn” from table e we saw that during of £ of total profits three surplusvalue makers pocketed only £ that in however out of £ total profits the same three virtuosi of “abstinence” pocketed £ in surplusvalue makers reached to £ in surplusvalue makers reached to £ in surplusvalue makers £ in surplusvalue makers £ in surplusvalue makers £ nearly half of the total annual profit in surplusvalue makers £ more than half of the total annual profit but the lion’s share which an inconceivably small number of land magnates in england scotland and ireland swallow up of the yearly national rental is so monstrous that the wisdom of the english state does not think fit to afford the same statistical materials about the distribution of rents as about the distribution of profits lord dufferin is one of those land magnates that rentrolls and profits can ever be “excessive” or that their plethora is in any way connected with plethora of the people’s misery is of course an idea as “disreputable” as “unsound” he keeps to facts the fact is that as the irish population diminishes the irish rentrolls swell that depopulation benefits the landlords therefore also benefits the soil and therefore the people that mere accessory of the soil he declares therefore that ireland is still overpopulated and the stream of emigration still flows too lazily to be perfectly happy ireland must get rid of at least onethird of a million of labouring men let no man imagine that this lord poetic into the bargain is a physician of the school of sangrado who as often as he did not find his patient better ordered phlebotomy and again phlebotomy until the patient lost his sickness at the same time as his blood lord dufferin demands a new bloodletting of onethird of a million only instead of about two millions in fact without the getting rid of these the millennium in erin is not to be the proof is easily given number and extent of farms in ireland in no acres farms not over acre farms over not over acres farms over not over acres farms over not over acres farms over not over acres farms over not over acres farms over acres total area – centralisation has from to destroyed principally farms of the first three categories under and not over acres these above all must disappear this gives “supernumerary” farmers and reckoning the families the low average of persons persons on the extravagant supposition that after the agricultural revolution is complete onefourth of these are again absorbable there remain for emigration persons categories of over and not over acres are as was known long since in england too small for capitalistic cultivation of corn and for sheepbreeding are almost vanishing quantities on the same supposition as before therefore there are further persons to emigrate total and as l’appétit vient en mangeant rentroll’s eyes will soon discover that ireland with ½ millions is still always miserable and miserable because she is overpopulated therefore her depopulation must go yet further that thus she may fulfil her true destiny that of an english sheepwalk and cattlepasture” like all good things in this bad world this profitable method has its drawbacks with the accumulation of rents in ireland the accumulation of the irish in america keeps pace the irishman banished by sheep and ox reappears on the other side of the ocean as a fenian and face to face with the old queen of the seas rises threatening and more threatening the young giant republic acerba fata romanos agunt scelusque fraternae necis a cruel fate torments the romans and the crime of fratricide part primitive accumulation chapter the secret of primitive accumulation we have seen how money is changed into capital how through capital surplusvalue is made and from surplusvalue more capital but the accumulation of capital presupposes surplusvalue surplusvalue presupposes capitalistic production capitalistic production presupposes the preexistence of considerable masses of capital and of labour power in the hands of producers of commodities the whole movement therefore seems to turn in a vicious circle out of which we can only get by supposing a primitive accumulation previous accumulation of adam smith preceding capitalistic accumulation an accumulation not the result of the capitalistic mode of production but its starting point this primitive accumulation plays in political economy about the same part as original sin in theology adam bit the apple and thereupon sin fell on the human race its origin is supposed to be explained when it is told as an anecdote of the past in times long gone by there were two sorts of people one the diligent intelligent and above all frugal elite the other lazy rascals spending their substance and more in riotous living the legend of theological original sin tells us certainly how man came to be condemned to eat his bread in the sweat of his brow but the history of economic original sin reveals to us that there are people to whom this is by no means essential never mind thus it came to pass that the former sort accumulated wealth and the latter sort had at last nothing to sell except their own skins and from this original sin dates the poverty of the great majority that despite all its labour has up to now nothing to sell but itself and the wealth of the few that increases constantly although they have long ceased to work such insipid childishness is every day preached to us in the defence of property m thiers eg had the assurance to repeat it with all the solemnity of a statesman to the french people once so spirituel but as soon as the question of property crops up it becomes a sacred duty to proclaim the intellectual food of the infant as the one thing fit for all ages and for all stages of development in actual history it is notorious that conquest enslavement robbery murder briefly force play the great part in the tender annals of political economy the idyllic reigns from time immemorial right and “labour” were from all time the sole means of enrichment the present year of course always excepted as a matter of fact the methods of primitive accumulation are anything but idyllic in themselves money and commodities are no more capital than are the means of production and of subsistence they want transforming into capital but this transformation itself can only take place under certain circumstances that centre in this viz that two very different kinds of commoditypossessors must come face to face and into contact on the one hand the owners of money means of production means of subsistence who are eager to increase the sum of values they possess by buying other people’s labour power on the other hand free labourers the sellers of their own labour power and therefore the sellers of labour free labourers in the double sense that neither they themselves form part and parcel of the means of production as in the case of slaves bondsmen c nor do the means of production belong to them as in the case of peasantproprietors they are therefore free from unencumbered by any means of production of their own with this polarisation of the market for commodities the fundamental conditions of capitalist production are given the capitalist system presupposes the complete separation of the labourers from all property in the means by which they can realize their labour as soon as capitalist production is once on its own legs it not only maintains this separation but reproduces it on a continually extending scale the process therefore that clears the way for the capitalist system can be none other than the process which takes away from the labourer the possession of his means of production a process that transforms on the one hand the social means of subsistence and of production into capital on the other the immediate producers into wage labourers the socalled primitive accumulation therefore is nothing else than the historical process of divorcing the producer from the means of production it appears as primitive because it forms the prehistoric stage of capital and of the mode of production corresponding with it the economic structure of capitalist society has grown out of the economic structure of feudal society the dissolution of the latter set free the elements of the former the immediate producer the labourer could only dispose of his own person after he had ceased to be attached to the soil and ceased to be the slave serf or bondsman of another to become a free seller of labour power who carries his commodity wherever he finds a market he must further have escaped from the regime of the guilds their rules for apprentices and journeymen and the impediments of their labour regulations hence the historical movement which changes the producers into wageworkers appears on the one hand as their emancipation from serfdom and from the fetters of the guilds and this side alone exists for our bourgeois historians but on the other hand these new freedmen became sellers of themselves only after they had been robbed of all their own means of production and of all the guarantees of existence afforded by the old feudal arrangements and the history of this their expropriation is written in the annals of mankind in letters of blood and fire the industrial capitalists these new potentates had on their part not only to displace the guild masters of handicrafts but also the feudal lords the possessors of the sources of wealth in this respect their conquest of social power appears as the fruit of a victorious struggle both against feudal lordship and its revolting prerogatives and against the guilds and the fetters they laid on the free development of production and the free exploitation of man by man the chevaliers d’industrie however only succeeded in supplanting the chevaliers of the sword by making use of events of which they themselves were wholly innocent they have risen by means as vile as those by which the roman freedman once on a time made himself the master of his patronus the starting point of the development that gave rise to the wage labourer as well as to the capitalist was the servitude of the labourer the advance consisted in a change of form of this servitude in the transformation of feudal exploitation into capitalist exploitation to understand its march we need not go back very far although we come across the first beginnings of capitalist production as early as the th or th century sporadically in certain towns of the mediterranean the capitalistic era dates from the th century wherever it appears the abolition of serfdom has been long effected and the highest development of the middle ages the existence of sovereign towns has been long on the wane in the history of primitive accumulation all revolutions are epochmaking that act as levers for the capital class in course of formation but above all those moments when great masses of men are suddenly and forcibly torn from their means of subsistence and hurled as free and “unattached” proletarians on the labourmarket the expropriation of the agricultural producer of the peasant from the soil is the basis of the whole process the history of this expropriation in different countries assumes different aspects and runs through its various phases in different orders of succession and at different periods in england alone which we take as our example has it the classic form chapter expropriation of the agricultural population from the land in england serfdom had practically disappeared in the last part of the th century the immense majority of the population consisted then and to a still larger extent in the th century of free peasant proprietors whatever was the feudal title under which their right of property was hidden in the larger seignorial domains the old bailiff himself a serf was displaced by the free farmer the wage labourers of agriculture consisted partly of peasants who utilised their leisure time by working on the large estates partly of an independent special class of wage labourers relatively and absolutely few in numbers the latter also were practically at the same time peasant farmers since besides their wages they had allotted to them arable land to the extent of or more acres together with their cottages besides they with the rest of the peasants enjoyed the usufruct of the common land which gave pasture to their cattle furnished them with timber firewood turf c in all countries of europe feudal production is characterised by division of the soil amongst the greatest possible number of subfeudatories the might of the feudal lord like that of the sovereign depended not on the length of his rent roll but on the number of his subjects and the latter depended on the number of peasant proprietors although therefore the english land after the norman conquest was distributed in gigantic baronies one of which often included some of the old anglosaxon lordships it was bestrewn with small peasant properties only here and there interspersed with great seignorial domains such conditions together with the prosperity of the towns so characteristic of the th century allowed of that wealth of the people which chancellor fortescue so eloquently paints in his “laudes legum angliae” but it excluded the possibility of capitalistic wealth the prelude of the revolution that laid the foundation of the capitalist mode of production was played in the last third of the th and the first decade of the th century a mass of free proletarians was hurled on the labour market by the breakingup of the bands of feudal retainers who as sir james steuart well says “everywhere uselessly filled house and castle” although the royal power itself a product of bourgeois development in its strife after absolute sovereignty forcibly hastened on the dissolution of these bands of retainers it was by no means the sole cause of it in insolent conflict with king and parliament the great feudal lords created an incomparably larger proletariat by the forcible driving of the peasantry from the land to which the latter had the same feudal right as the lord himself and by the usurpation of the common lands the rapid rise of the flemish wool manufactures and the corresponding rise in the price of wool in england gave the direct impulse to these evictions the old nobility had been devoured by the great feudal wars the new nobility was the child of its time for which money was the power of all powers transformation of arable land into sheepwalks was therefore its cry harrison in his “description of england prefixed to holinshed’s chronicles” describes how the expropriation of small peasants is ruining the country “what care our great encroachers” the dwellings of the peasants and the cottages of the labourers were razed to the ground or doomed to decay “if” says harrison “the old records of euerie manour be sought it will soon appear that in some manour seventeene eighteene or twentie houses are shrunk that england was neuer less furnished with people than at the present of cities and townes either utterly decaied or more than a quarter or half diminished though some one be a little increased here or there of townes pulled downe for sheepewalks and no more but the lordships now standing in them i could saie somewhat” the complaints of these old chroniclers are always exaggerated but they reflect faithfully the impression made on contemporaries by the revolution in the conditions of production a comparison of the writings of chancellor fortescue and thomas more reveals the gulf between the th and th century as thornton rightly has it the english working class was precipitated without any transition from its golden into its iron age legislation was terrified at this revolution it did not yet stand on that height of civilisation where the “wealth of the nation” ie the formation of capital and the reckless exploitation and impoverishing of the mass of the people figure as the ultima thule of all statecraft in his history of henry vii bacon says “inclosures at that time began to be more frequent whereby arable land which could not be manured without people and families was turned into pasture which was easily rid by a few herdsmen and tenancies for years lives and at will whereupon much of the yeomanry lived were turned into demesnes this bred a decay of people and by consequence a decay of towns churches tithes and the like in remedying of this inconvenience the king’s wisdom was admirable and the parliament’s at that time they took a course to take away depopulating enclosures and depopulating pasturage” an act of henry vii cap forbad the destruction of all “houses of husbandry” to which at least acres of land belonged by an act henry viii the same law was renewed it recites among other things that many farms and large flocks of cattle especially of sheep are concentrated in the hands of a few men whereby the rent of land has much risen and tillage has fallen off churches and houses have been pulled down and marvellous numbers of people have been deprived of the means wherewith to maintain themselves and their families the act therefore ordains the rebuilding of the decayed farmsteads and fixes a proportion between corn land and pasture land c an act of recites that some owners possess sheep and limits the number to be owned to the cry of the people and the legislation directed for years after henry vii against the expropriation of the small farmers and peasants were alike fruitless the secret of their inefficiency bacon without knowing it reveals to us “the device of king henry vii” says bacon in his “essays civil and moral” essay “was profound and admirable in making farms and houses of husbandry of a standard that is maintained with such a proportion of land unto them as may breed a subject to live in convenient plenty and no servile condition and to keep the plough in the hands of the owners and not mere hirelings” what the capitalist system demanded was on the other hand a degraded and almost servile condition of the mass of the people the transformation of them into mercenaries and of their means of labour into capital during this transformation period legislation also strove to retain the acres of land by the cottage of the agricultural wage labourer and forbad him to take lodgers into his cottage in the reign of james i roger crocker of front mill was condemned for having built a cottage on the manor of front mill without acres of land attached to the same in perpetuity as late as charles i’s reign a royal commission was appointed to enforce the carrying out of the old laws especially that referring to the acres of land even in cromwell’s time the building of a house within miles of london was forbidden unless it was endowed with acres of land as late as the first half of the th century complaint is made if the cottage of the agricultural labourer has not an adjunct of one or two acres of land nowadays he is lucky if it is furnished with a little garden or if he may rent far away from his cottage a few roods “landlords and farmers” says dr hunter “work here hand in hand a few acres to the cottage would make the labourers too independent” the process of forcible expropriation of the people received in the th century a new and frightful impulse from the reformation and from the consequent colossal spoliation of the church property the catholic church was at the time of the reformation feudal proprietor of a great part of the english land the suppression of the monasteries c hurled their inmates into the proletariat the estates of the church were to a large extent given away to rapacious royal favourites or sold at a nominal price to speculating farmers and citizens who drove out en masse the hereditary subtenants and threw their holdings into one the legally guaranteed property of the poorer folk in a part of the church’s tithes was tacitly confiscated “pauper ubique jacet” cried queen elizabeth after a journey through england in the rd year of her reign the nation was obliged to recognise pauperism officially by the introduction of a poorrate “the authors of this law seem to have been ashamed to state the grounds of it for contrary to traditional usage it has no preamble whatever” by the th of charles i ch it was declared perpetual and in fact only in did it take a new and harsher form these immediate results of the reformation were not its most lasting ones the property of the church formed the religious bulwark of the traditional conditions of landed property with its fall these were no longer tenable even in the last decade of the th century the yeomanry the class of independent peasants were more numerous than the class of farmers they had formed the backbone of cromwell’s strength and even according to the confession of macaulay stood in favourable contrast to the drunken squires and to their servants the country clergy who had to marry their masters’ castoff mistresses about the yeomanry had disappeared and so had in the last decade of the th century the last trace of the common land of the agricultural labourer we leave on one side here the purely economic causes of the agricultural revolution we deal only with the forcible means employed after the restoration of the stuarts the landed proprietors carried by legal means an act of usurpation effected everywhere on the continent without any legal formality they abolished the feudal tenure of land ie they got rid of all its obligations to the state “indemnified” the state by taxes on the peasantry and the rest of the mass of the people vindicated for themselves the rights of modern private property in estates to which they had only a feudal title and finally passed those laws of settlement which mutatis mutandis had the same effect on the english agricultural labourer as the edict of the tartar boris godunof on the russian peasantry the “glorious revolution” brought into power along with william of orange the landlord and capitalist appropriators of surplusvalue they inaugurated the new era by practising on a colossal scale thefts of state lands thefts that had been hitherto managed more modestly these estates were given away sold at a ridiculous figure or even annexed to private estates by direct seizure all this happened without the slightest observation of legal etiquette the crown lands thus fraudulently appropriated together with the robbery of the church estates as far as these had not been lost again during the republican revolution form the basis of the today princely domains of the english oligarchy the bourgeois capitalists favoured the operation with the view among others to promoting free trade in land to extending the domain of modern agriculture on the large farmsystem and to increasing their supply of the free agricultural proletarians ready to hand besides the new landed aristocracy was the natural ally of the new bankocracy of the newlyhatched haute finance and of the large manufacturers then depending on protective duties the english bourgeoisie acted for its own interest quite as wisely as did the swedish bourgeoisie who reversing the process hand in hand with their economic allies the peasantry helped the kings in the forcible resumption of the crown lands from the oligarchy this happened since under charles x and charles xi communal property – always distinct from the state property just dealt with – was an old teutonic institution which lived on under cover of feudalism we have seen how the forcible usurpation of this generally accompanied by the turning of arable into pasture land begins at the end of the th and extends into the th century but at that time the process was carried on by means of individual acts of violence against which legislation for a hundred and fifty years fought in vain the advance made by the th century shows itself in this that the law itself becomes now the instrument of the theft of the people’s land although the large farmers make use of their little independent methods as well the parliamentary form of the robbery is that of acts for enclosures of commons in other words decrees by which the landlords grant themselves the people’s land as private property decrees of expropriation of the people sir f m eden refutes his own crafty special pleading in which he tries to represent communal property as the private property of the great landlords who have taken the place of the feudal lords when he himself demands a “general act of parliament for the enclosure of commons” admitting thereby that a parliamentary coup d’état is necessary for its transformation into private property and moreover calls on the legislature for the indemnification for the expropriated poor whilst the place of the independent yeoman was taken by tenants at will small farmers on yearly leases a servile rabble dependent on the pleasure of the landlords the systematic robbery of the communal lands helped especially next to the theft of the state domains to swell those large farms that were called in the th century capital farms or merchant farms and to “set free” the agricultural population as proletarians for manufacturing industry the th century however did not yet recognise as fully as the th the identity between national wealth and the poverty of the people hence the most vigorous polemic in the economic literature of that time on the “enclosure of commons” from the mass of materials that lie before me i give a few extracts that will throw a strong light on the circumstances of the time “in several parishes of hertfordshire” writes one indignant person “ farms numbering on the average acres have been melted up into three farms” “in northamptonshire and leicestershire the enclosure of common lands has taken place on a very large scale and most of the new lordships resulting from the enclosure have been turned into pasturage in consequence of which many lordships have not now acres ploughed yearly in which were ploughed formerly the ruins of former dwellinghouses barns stables c” are the sole traces of the former inhabitants “an hundred houses and families have in some openfield villages dwindled to eight or ten the landholders in most parishes that have been enclosed only or years are very few in comparison of the numbers who occupied them in their openfield state it is no uncommon thing for or wealthy graziers to engross a large enclosed lordship which was before in the hands of or farmers and as many smaller tenants and proprietors all these are hereby thrown out of their livings with their families and many other families who were chiefly employed and supported by them” it was not only the land that lay waste but often land cultivated either in common or held under a definite rent paid to the community that was annexed by the neighbouring landlords under pretext of enclosure “i have here in view enclosures of open fields and lands already improved it is acknowledged by even the writers in defence of enclosures that these diminished villages increase the monopolies of farms raise the prices of provisions and produce depopulation and even the enclosure of waste lands as now carried on bears hard on the poor by depriving them of a part of their subsistence and only goes towards increasing farms already too large” “when” says dr price “this land gets into the hands of a few great farmers the consequence must be that the little farmers” earlier designated by him “a multitude of little proprietors and tenants who maintain themselves and families by the produce of the ground they occupy by sheep kept on a common by poultry hogs c and who therefore have little occasion to purchase any of the means of subsistence” “will be converted into a body of men who earn their subsistence by working for others and who will be under a necessity of going to market for all they want there will perhaps be more labour because there will be more compulsion to it towns and manufactures will increase because more will be driven to them in quest of places and employment this is the way in which the engrossing of farms naturally operates and this is the way in which for many years it has been actually operating in this kingdom” he sums up the effect of the enclosures thus “upon the whole the circumstances of the lower ranks of men are altered in almost every respect for the worse from little occupiers of land they are reduced to the state of daylabourers and hirelings and at the same time their subsistence in that state has become more difficult” in fact usurpation of the common lands and the revolution in agriculture accompanying this told so acutely on the agricultural labourers that even according to eden between and their wages began to fall below the minimum and to be supplemented by official poorlaw relief their wages he says “were not more than enough for the absolute necessaries of life” let us hear for a moment a defender of enclosures and an opponent of dr price “not is it a consequence that there must be depopulation because men are not seen wasting their labour in the open field if by converting the little farmers into a body of men who must work for others more labour is produced it is an advantage which the nation” to which of course the “converted” ones do not belong “should wish for the produce being greater when their joint labours are employed on one farm there will be a surplus for manufactures and by this means manufactures one of the mines of the nation will increase in proportion to the quantity of corn produced” the stoical peace of mind with which the political economist regards the most shameless violation of the “sacred rights of property” and the grossest acts of violence to persons as soon as they are necessary to lay the foundations of the capitalistic mode of production is shown by sir f m eden philanthropist and tory to boot the whole series of thefts outrages and popular misery that accompanied the forcible expropriation of the people from the last third of the th to the end of the th century lead him merely to the comfortable conclusion “the due proportion between arable land and pasture had to be established during the whole of the th and the greater part of the th century there was one acre of pasture to and even of arable land about the middle of the th century the proportion was changed of acres of pasture to later on of acres of pasture to one of arable until at last the just proportion of acres of pasture to one of arable land was attained” in the th century the very memory of the connexion between the agricultural labourer and the communal property had of course vanished to say nothing of more recent times have the agricultural population received a farthing of compensation for the acres of common land which between and were stolen from them and by parliamentary devices presented to the landlords by the landlords the last process of wholesale expropriation of the agricultural population from the soil is finally the socalled clearing of estates ie the sweeping men off them all the english methods hitherto considered culminated in “clearing” as we saw in the picture of modern conditions given in a former chapter where there are no more independent peasants to get rid of the “clearing” of cottages begins so that the agricultural labourers do not find on the soil cultivated by them even the spot necessary for their own housing but what “clearing of estates” really and properly signifies we learn only in the promised land of modern romance the highlands of scotland there the process is distinguished by its systematic character by the magnitude of the scale on which it is carried out at one blow in ireland landlords have gone to the length of sweeping away several villages at once in scotland areas as large as german principalities are dealt with finally by the peculiar form of property under which the embezzled lands were held the highland celts were organised in clans each of which was the owner of the land on which it was settled the representative of the clan its chief or “great man” was only the titular owner of this property just as the queen of england is the titular owner of all the national soil when the english government succeeded in suppressing the intestine wars of these “great men” and their constant incursions into the lowland plains the chiefs of the clans by no means gave up their timehonoured trade as robbers they only changed its form on their own authority they transformed their nominal right into a right of private property and as this brought them into collision with their clansmen resolved to drive them out by open force “a king of england might as well claim to drive his subjects into the sea” says professor newman this revolution which began in scotland after the last rising of the followers of the pretender can be followed through its first phases in the writings of sir james steuart and james anderson in the th century the huntedout gaels were forbidden to emigrate from the country with a view to driving them by force to glasgow and other manufacturing towns as an example of the method obtaining in the th century the “clearing” made by the duchess of sutherland will suffice here this person well instructed in economy resolved on entering upon her government to effect a radical cure and to turn the whole country whose population had already been by earlier processes of the like kind reduced to into a sheepwalk from to these inhabitants about families were systematically hunted and rooted out all their villages were destroyed and burnt all their fields turned into pasturage british soldiers enforced this eviction and came to blows with the inhabitants one old woman was burnt to death in the flames of the hut which she refused to leave thus this fine lady appropriated acres of land that had from time immemorial belonged to the clan she assigned to the expelled inhabitants about acres on the seashore – acres per family the acres had until this time lain waste and brought in no income to their owners the duchess in the nobility of her heart actually went so far as to let these at an average rent of s d per acre to the clansmen who for centuries had shed their blood for her family the whole of the stolen clanland she divided into great sheep farms each inhabited by a single family for the most part imported english farmservants in the year the gaels were already replaced by sheep the remnant of the aborigines flung on the seashore tried to live by catching fish they became amphibious and lived as an english author says half on land and half on water and withal only half on both but the brave gaels must expiate yet more bitterly their idolatry romantic and of the mountains for the “great men” of the clan the smell of their fish rose to the noses of the great men they scented some profit in it and let the seashore to the great fishmongers of london for the second time the gaels were hunted out but finally part of the sheepwalks are turned into deer preserves every one knows that there are no real forests in england the deer in the parks of the great are demurely domestic cattle fat as london aldermen scotland is therefore the last refuge of the “noble passion” “in the highlands” says somers in “new forests are springing up like mushrooms here on one side of gaick you have the new forest of glenfeshie and there on the other you have the new forest of ardverikie in the same line you have the black mount an immense waste also recently erected from east to west – from the neighbourhood of aberdeen to the crags of oban – you have now a continuous line of forests while in other parts of the highlands there are the new forests of loch archaig glengarry glenmoriston c sheep were introduced into glens which had been the seats of communities of small farmers and the latter were driven to seek subsistence on coarser and more sterile tracks of soil now deer are supplanting sheep and these are once more dispossessing the small tenants who will necessarily be driven down upon still coarser land and to more grinding penury deerforests and the people cannot coexist one or other of the two must yield let the forests be increased in number and extent during the next quarter of a century as they have been in the last and the gaels will perish from their native soil this movement among the highland proprietors is with some a matter of ambition with some love of sport while others of a more practical cast follow the trade in deer with an eye solely to profit for it is a fact that a mountain range laid out in forest is in many cases more profitable to the proprietor than when let as a sheepwalk the huntsman who wants a deerforest limits his offers by no other calculation than the extent of his purse sufferings have been inflicted in the highlands scarcely less severe than those occasioned by the policy of the norman kings deer have received extended ranges while men have been hunted within a narrower and still narrower circle one after one the liberties of the people have been cloven down and the oppressions are daily on the increase the clearance and dispersion of the people is pursued by the proprietors as a settled principle as an agricultural necessity just as trees and brushwood are cleared from the wastes of america or australia and the operation goes on in a quiet businesslike way c” the spoliation of the church’s property the fraudulent alienation of the state domains the robbery of the common lands the usurpation of feudal and clan property and its transformation into modern private property under circumstances of reckless terrorism were just so many idyllic methods of primitive accumulation they conquered the field for capitalistic agriculture made the soil part and parcel of capital and created for the town industries the necessary supply of a “free” and outlawed proletariat chapter bloody legislation against the expropriated from the end of the th century forcing down of wages by acts of parliament the proletariat created by the breaking up of the bands of feudal retainers and by the forcible expropriation of the people from the soil this “free” proletariat could not possibly be absorbed by the nascent manufactures as fast as it was thrown upon the world on the other hand these men suddenly dragged from their wonted mode of life could not as suddenly adapt themselves to the discipline of their new condition they were turned en masse into beggars robbers vagabonds partly from inclination in most cases from stress of circumstances hence at the end of the th and during the whole of the th century throughout western europe a bloody legislation against vagabondage the fathers of the present working class were chastised for their enforced transformation into vagabonds and paupers legislation treated them as “voluntary” criminals and assumed that it depended on their own good will to go on working under the old conditions that no longer existed in england this legislation began under henry vii henry viii beggars old and unable to work receive a beggar’s licence on the other hand whipping and imprisonment for sturdy vagabonds they are to be tied to the carttail and whipped until the blood streams from their bodies then to swear an oath to go back to their birthplace or to where they have lived the last three years and to “put themselves to labour” what grim irony in henry viii the former statute is repeated but strengthened with new clauses for the second arrest for vagabondage the whipping is to be repeated and half the ear sliced off but for the third relapse the offender is to be executed as a hardened criminal and enemy of the common weal edward vi a statute of the first year of his reign ordains that if anyone refuses to work he shall be condemned as a slave to the person who has denounced him as an idler the master shall feed his slave on bread and water weak broth and such refuse meat as he thinks fit he has the right to force him to do any work no matter how disgusting with whip and chains if the slave is absent a fortnight he is condemned to slavery for life and is to be branded on forehead or back with the letter s if he runs away thrice he is to be executed as a felon the master can sell him bequeath him let him out on hire as a slave just as any other personal chattel or cattle if the slaves attempt anything against the masters they are also to be executed justices of the peace on information are to hunt the rascals down if it happens that a vagabond has been idling about for three days he is to be taken to his birthplace branded with a redhot iron with the letter v on the breast and be set to work in chains in the streets or at some other labour if the vagabond gives a false birthplace he is then to become the slave for life of this place of its inhabitants or its corporation and to be branded with an s all persons have the right to take away the children of the vagabonds and to keep them as apprentices the young men until the th year the girls until the th if they run away they are to become up to this age the slaves of their masters who can put them in irons whip them c if they like every master may put an iron ring round the neck arms or legs of his slave by which to know him more easily and to be more certain of him the last part of this statute provides that certain poor people may be employed by a place or by persons who are willing to give them food and drink and to find them work this kind of parish slaves was kept up in england until far into the th century under the name of “roundsmen” elizabeth unlicensed beggars above years of age are to be severely flogged and branded on the left ear unless some one will take them into service for two years in case of a repetition of the offence if they are over they are to be executed unless some one will take them into service for two years but for the third offence they are to be executed without mercy as felons similar statutes elizabeth c and another of james any one wandering about and begging is declared a rogue and a vagabond justices of the peace in petty sessions are authorised to have them publicly whipped and for the first offence to imprison them for months for the second for years whilst in prison they are to be whipped as much and as often as the justices of the peace think fit incorrigible and dangerous rogues are to be branded with an r on the left shoulder and set to hard labour and if they are caught begging again to be executed without mercy these statutes legally binding until the beginning of the th century were only repealed by anne c similar laws in france where by the middle of the th century a kingdom of vagabonds truands was established in paris even at the beginning of louis xvi’s reign ordinance of july th every man in good health from to years of age if without means of subsistence and not practising a trade is to be sent to the galleys of the same nature are the statute of charles v for the netherlands october the first edict of the states and towns of holland march the “plakaat” of the united provinces june c thus were the agricultural people first forcibly expropriated from the soil driven from their homes turned into vagabonds and then whipped branded tortured by laws grotesquely terrible into the discipline necessary for the wage system it is not enough that the conditions of labour are concentrated in a mass in the shape of capital at the one pole of society while at the other are grouped masses of men who have nothing to sell but their labourpower neither is it enough that they are compelled to sell it voluntarily the advance of capitalist production develops a working class which by education tradition habit looks upon the conditions of that mode of production as selfevident laws of nature the organisation of the capitalist process of production once fully developed breaks down all resistance the constant generation of a relative surpluspopulation keeps the law of supply and demand of labour and therefore keeps wages in a rut that corresponds with the wants of capital the dull compulsion of economic relations completes the subjection of the labourer to the capitalist direct force outside economic conditions is of course still used but only exceptionally in the ordinary run of things the labourer can be left to the “natural laws of production” ie to his dependence on capital a dependence springing from and guaranteed in perpetuity by the conditions of production themselves it is otherwise during the historic genesis of capitalist production the bourgeoisie at its rise wants and uses the power of the state to “regulate” wages ie to force them within the limits suitable for surplusvalue making to lengthen the working day and to keep the labourer himself in the normal degree of dependence this is an essential element of the socalled primitive accumulation the class of wage labourers which arose in the latter half of the th century formed then and in the following century only a very small part of the population well protected in its position by the independent peasant proprietary in the country and the guildorganisation in the town in country and town master and workmen stood close together socially the subordination of labour to capital was only formal – ie the mode of production itself had as yet no specific capitalistic character variable capital preponderated greatly over constant the demand for wage labour grew therefore rapidly with every accumulation of capital whilst the supply of wage labour followed but slowly a large part of the national product changed later into a fund of capitalist accumulation then still entered into the consumptionfund of the labourer legislation on wage labour from the first aimed at the exploitation of the labourer and as it advanced always equally hostile to him is started in england by the statute of labourers of edward iii the ordinance of in france issued in the name of king john corresponds with it english and french legislation run parallel and are identical in purport so far as the labourstatutes aim at compulsory extension of the working day i do not return to them as this point was treated earlier chap x section the statute of labourers was passed at the urgent instance of the house of commons a tory says naively “formerly the poor demanded such high wages as to threaten industry and wealth next their wages are so low as to threaten industry and wealth equally and perhaps more but in another way” a tariff of wages was fixed by law for town and country for piecework and daywork the agricultural labourers were to hire themselves out by the year the town ones “in open market” it was forbidden under pain of imprisonment to pay higher wages than those fixed by the statute but the taking of higher wages was more severely punished than the giving them so also in sections and of the statute of apprentices of elizabeth ten days’ imprisonment is decreed for him that pays the higher wages but twentyone days for him that receives them a statute of increased the penalties and authorised the masters to extort labour at the legal rate of wages by corporal punishment all combinations contracts oaths c by which masons and carpenters reciprocally bound themselves were declared null and void coalition of the labourers is treated as a heinous crime from the th century to the year of the repeal of the laws against trades’ unions the spirit of the statute of labourers of and of its offshoots comes out clearly in the fact that indeed a maximum of wages is dictated by the state but on no account a minimum in the th century the condition of the labourers had as we know become much worse the money wage rose but not in proportion to the depreciation of money and the corresponding rise in the prices of commodities wages therefore in reality fell nevertheless the laws for keeping them down remained in force together with the earclipping and branding of those “whom no one was willing to take into service” by the statute of apprentices elizabeth c the justices of the peace were empowered to fix certain wages and to modify them according to the time of the year and the price of commodities james i extended these regulations of labour also to weavers spinners and all possible categories of workers george ii extended the laws against coalitions of labourers to manufactures in the manufacturing period par excellence the capitalist mode of production had become sufficiently strong to render legal regulation of wages as impracticable as it was unnecessary but the ruling classes were unwilling in case of necessity to be without the weapons of the old arsenal still george ii forbade a higher day’s wage than s ½d for journeymen tailors in and around london except in cases of general mourning still george iii c gave the regulation of the wages of silkweavers to the justices of the peace still in it required two judgments of the higher courts to decide whether the mandates of justices of the peace as to wages held good also for nonagricultural labourers still in an act of parliament ordered that the wages of the scotch miners should continue to be regulated by a statute of elizabeth and two scotch acts of and how completely in the meantime circumstances had changed is proved by an occurrence unheardof before in the english lower house in that place where for more than years laws had been made for the maximum beyond which wages absolutely must not rise whitbread in proposed a legal minimum wage for agricultural labourers pitt opposed this but confessed that the “condition of the poor was cruel” finally in the laws for the regulation of wages were repealed they were an absurd anomaly since the capitalist regulated his factory by his private legislation and could by the poorrates make up the wage of the agricultural labourer to the indispensable minimum the provisions of the labour statutes as to contracts between master and workman as to giving notice and the like which only allow of a civil action against the contractbreaking master but on the contrary permit a criminal action against the contractbreaking workman are to this hour in full force the barbarous laws against trades’ unions fell in before the threatening bearing of the proletariat despite this they fell only in part certain beautiful fragments of the old statute vanished only in finally the act of parliament of june made a pretence of removing the last traces of this class of legislation by legal recognition of trades’ unions but an act of parliament of the same date an act to amend the criminal law relating to violence threats and molestation reestablished in point of fact the former state of things in a new shape by this parliamentary escamotage the means which the labourers could use in a strike or lockout were withdrawn from the laws common to all citizens and placed under exceptional penal legislation the interpretation of which fell to the masters themselves in their capacity as justices of the peace two years earlier the same house of commons and the same mr gladstone in the wellknown straightforward fashion brought in a bill for the abolition of all exceptional penal legislation against the working class but this was never allowed to go beyond the second reading and the matter was thus protracted until at last the “great liberal party” by an alliance with the tories found courage to turn against the very proletariat that had carried it into power not content with this treachery the “great liberal party” allowed the english judges ever complaisant in the service of the ruling classes to dig up again the earlier laws against “conspiracy” and to apply them to coalitions of labourers we see that only against its will and under the pressure of the masses did the english parliament give up the laws against strikes and trades’ unions after it had itself for years held with shameless egoism the position of a permanent trades’ union of the capitalists against the labourers during the very first storms of the revolution the french bourgeoisie dared to take away from the workers the right of association but just acquired by a decree of june they declared all coalition of the workers as “an attempt against liberty and the declaration of the rights of man” punishable by a fine of livres together with deprivation of the rights of an active citizen for one year this law which by means of state compulsion confined the struggle between capital and labour within limits comfortable for capital has outlived revolutions and changes of dynasties even the reign of terror left it untouched it was but quite recently struck out of the penal code nothing is more characteristic than the pretext for this bourgeois coup d’état “granting” says chapelier the reporter of the select committee on this law “that wages ought to be a little higher than they are that they ought to be high enough for him that receives them to be free from that state of absolute dependence due to the want of the necessaries of life and which is almost that of slavery” yet the workers must not be allowed to come to any understanding about their own interests nor to act in common and thereby lessen their “absolute dependence which is almost that of slavery” because forsooth in doing this they injure “the freedom of their cidevant masters the present entrepreneurs” and because a coalition against the despotism of the quondam masters of the corporations is – guess what – is a restoration of the corporations abolished by the french constitution chapter genesis of the capitalist farmer now that we have considered the forcible creation of a class of outlawed proletarians the bloody discipline that turned them into wage labourers the disgraceful action of the state which employed the police to accelerate the accumulation of capital by increasing the degree of exploitation of labour the question remains whence came the capitalists originally for the expropriation of the agricultural population creates directly none but the greatest landed proprietors as far however as concerns the genesis of the farmer we can so to say put our hand on it because it is a slow process evolving through many centuries the serfs as well as the free small proprietors held land under very different tenures and were therefore emancipated under very different economic conditions in england the first form of the farmer is the bailiff himself a serf his position is similar to that of the old roman villicus only in a more limited sphere of action during the second half of the th century he is replaced by a farmer whom the landlord provided with seed cattle and implements his condition is not very different from that of the peasant only he exploits more wage labour soon he becomes a metayer a halffarmer he advances one part of the agricultural stock the landlord the other the two divide the total product in proportions determined by contract this form quickly disappears in england to give the place to the farmer proper who makes his own capital breed by employing wage labourers and pays a part of the surplusproduct in money or in kind to the landlord as rent so long during the th century as the independent peasant and the farmlabourer working for himself as well as for wages enriched themselves by their own labour the circumstances of the farmer and his field of production were equally mediocre the agricultural revolution which commenced in the last third of the th century and continued during almost the whole of the th excepting however its last decade enriched him just as speedily as it impoverished the mass of the agricultural people the usurpation of the common lands allowed him to augment greatly his stock of cattle almost without cost whilst they yielded him a richer supply of manure for the tillage of the soil to this was added in the th century a very important element at that time the contracts for farms ran for a long time often for years the progressive fall in the value of the precious metals and therefore of money brought the farmers golden fruit apart from all the other circumstances discussed above it lowered wages a portion of the latter was now added to the profits of the farm the continuous rise in the price of corn wool meat in a word of all agricultural produce swelled the money capital of the farm without any action on his part whilst the rent he paid being calculated on the old value of money diminished in reality thus they grew rich at the expense both of their labourers and their landlords no wonder therefore that england at the end of the th century had a class of capitalist farmers rich considering the circumstances of the time chapter reaction of the agricultural revolution on industry creation of the homemarket for industrial capital the expropriation and expulsion of the agricultural population intermittent but renewed again and again supplied as we saw the town industries with a mass of proletarians entirely unconnected with the corporate guilds and unfettered by them a fortunate circumstance that makes old a anderson not to be confounded with james anderson in his “history of commerce” believe in the direct intervention of providence we must still pause a moment on this element of primitive accumulation the thinningout of the independent selfsupporting peasants not only brought about the crowding together of the industrial proletariat in the way that geoffrey saint hilaire explained the condensation of cosmical matter at one place by its rarefaction at another in spite of the smaller number of its cultivators the soil brought forth as much or more produce after as before because the revolution in the conditions of landed property was accompanied by improved methods of culture greater cooperation concentration of the means of production c and because not only were the agricultural wage labourers put on the strain more intensely but the field of production on which they worked for themselves became more and more contracted with the setting free of a part of the agricultural population therefore their former means of nourishment were also set free they were now transformed into material elements of variable capital the peasant expropriated and cast adrift must buy their value in the form of wages from his new master the industrial capitalist that which holds good of the means of subsistence holds with the raw materials of industry dependent upon home agriculture they were transformed into an element of constant capital suppose eg a part of the westphalian peasants who at the time of frederick ii all span flax forcibly expropriated and hunted from the soil and the other part that remained turned into day labourers of large farmers at the same time arise large establishments for flaxspinning and weaving in which the men “set free” now work for wages the flax looks exactly as before not a fibre of it is changed but a new social soul has popped into its body it forms now a part of the constant capital of the master manufacturer formerly divided among a number of small producers who cultivated it themselves and with their families spun it in retail fashion it is now concentrated in the hand of one capitalist who sets others to spin and weave it for him the extra labour expended in flaxspinning realised itself formerly in extra income to numerous peasant families or maybe in frederick ii’s time in taxes pour le roi de prusse it realises itself now in profit for a few capitalists the spindles and looms formerly scattered over the face of the country are now crowded together in a few great labourbarracks together with the labourers and the raw material and spindles looms raw material are now transformed from means of independent existence for the spinners and weavers into means for commanding them and sucking out of them unpaid labour one does not perceive when looking at the large manufactories and the large farms that they have originated from the throwing into one of many small centres of production and have been built up by the expropriation of many small independent producers nevertheless the popular intuition was not at fault in the time of mirabeau the lion of the revolution the great manufactories were still called manufactures réunies workshops thrown into one as we speak of fields thrown into one says mirabeau “we are only paying attention to the grand manufactories in which hundreds of men work under a director and which are commonly called manufactures réunies those where a very large number of labourers work each separately and on his own account are hardly considered they are placed at an infinite distance from the others this is a great error as the latter alone make a really important object of national prosperity the large workshop manufacture réunie will enrich prodigiously one or two entrepreneurs but the labourers will only be journeymen paid more or less and will not have any share in the success of the undertaking in the discrete workshop manufacture separée on the contrary no one will become rich but many labourers will be comfortable the saving and the industrious will be able to amass a little capital to put by a little for a birth of a child for an illness for themselves or their belongings the number of saving and industrious labourers will increase because they will see in good conduct in activity a means of essentially bettering their condition and not of obtaining a small rise in wages that can never be of any importance of the future and whose sole result is to place men in the position to live a little better but only from day to day the large workshops undertakings of certain private persons who pay labourers from day to day to work for their gain may be able to put these private individuals at their ease but they will never be an object worth the attention of governments discrete workshops for the most part combined with cultivation of small holdings are the only free ones” the expropriation and eviction of a part of the agricultural population not only set free for industrial capital the labourers their means of subsistence and material for labour it also created the homemarket in fact the events that transformed the small peasants into wage labourers and their means of subsistence and of labour into material elements of capital created at the same time a homemarket for the latter formerly the peasant family produced the means of subsistence and the raw materials which they themselves for the most part consumed these raw materials and means of subsistence have now become commodities the large farmer sells them he finds his market in manufactures yarn linen coarse woollen stuffs – things whose raw materials had been within the reach of every peasant family had been spun and woven by it for its own use – were now transformed into articles of manufacture to which the country districts at once served for markets the many scattered customers whom stray artisans until now had found in the numerous small producers working on their own account concentrate themselves now into one great market provided for by industrial capital thus hand in hand with the expropriation of the selfsupporting peasants with their separation from their means of production goes the destruction of rural domestic industry the process of separation between manufacture and agriculture and only the destruction of rural domestic industry can give the internal market of a country that extension and consistence which the capitalist mode of production requires still the manufacturing period properly so called does not succeed in carrying out this transformation radically and completely it will be remembered that manufacture properly so called conquers but partially the domain of national production and always rests on the handicrafts of the town and the domestic industry of the rural districts as its ultimate basis if it destroys these in one form in particular branches at certain points it calls them up again elsewhere because it needs them for the preparation of raw material up to a certain point it produces therefore a new class of small villagers who while following the cultivation of the soil as an accessory calling find their chief occupation in industrial labour the products of which they sell to the manufacturers directly or through the medium of merchants this is one though not the chief cause of a phenomenon which at first puzzles the student of english history from the last third of the th century he finds continually complaints only interrupted at certain intervals about the encroachment of capitalist farming in the country districts and the progressive destruction of the peasantry on the other hand he always finds this peasantry turning up again although in diminished number and always under worse conditions the chief reason is england is at one time chiefly a cultivator of corn at another chiefly a breeder of cattle in alternate periods and with these the extent of peasant cultivation fluctuates modern industry alone and finally supplies in machinery the lasting basis of capitalistic agriculture expropriates radically the enormous majority of the agricultural population and completes the separation between agriculture and rural domestic industry whose roots – spinning and weaving – it tears up it therefore also for the first time conquers for industrial capital the entire home market chapter the genesis of the industrial capitalist the genesis of the industrial capitalist did not proceed in such a gradual way as that of the farmer doubtless many small guildmasters and yet more independent small artisans or even wage labourers transformed themselves into small capitalists and by gradually extending exploitation of wage labour and corresponding accumulation into fullblown capitalists in the infancy of capitalist production things often happened as in the infancy of medieval towns where the question which of the escaped serfs should be master and which servant was in great part decided by the earlier or later date of their flight the snail’s pace of this method corresponded in no wise with the commercial requirements of the new world market that the great discoveries of the end of the th century created but the middle ages had handed down two distinct forms of capital which mature in the most different economic social formations and which before the era of the capitalist mode of production are considered as capital quand même all the same – usurer’s capital and merchant’s capital “at present all the wealth of society goes first into the possession of the capitalist he pays the landowner his rent the labourer his wages the tax and tithe gatherer their claims and keeps a large indeed the largest and a continually augmenting share of the annual produce of labour for himself the capitalist may now be said to be the first owner of all the wealth of the community though no law has conferred on him the right to this property this change has been effected by the taking of interest on capital and it is not a little curious that all the lawgivers of europe endeavoured to prevent this by statutes viz statutes against usury the power of the capitalist over all the wealth of the country is a complete change in the right of property and by what law or series of laws was it effected” the author should have remembered that revolutions are not made by laws the money capital formed by means of usury and commerce was prevented from turning into industrial capital in the country by the feudal constitution in the towns by the guild organisation these fetters vanished with the dissolution of feudal society with the expropriation and partial eviction of the country population the new manufactures were established at seaports or at inland points beyond the control of the old municipalities and their guilds hence in england an embittered struggle of the corporate towns against these new industrial nurseries the discovery of gold and silver in america the extirpation enslavement and entombment in mines of the aboriginal population the beginning of the conquest and looting of the east indies the turning of africa into a warren for the commercial hunting of blackskins signalised the rosy dawn of the era of capitalist production these idyllic proceedings are the chief momenta of primitive accumulation on their heels treads the commercial war of the european nations with the globe for a theatre it begins with the revolt of the netherlands from spain assumes giant dimensions in england’s antijacobin war and is still going on in the opium wars against china c the different momenta of primitive accumulation distribute themselves now more or less in chronological order particularly over spain portugal holland france and england in england at the end of the th century they arrive at a systematical combination embracing the colonies the national debt the modern mode of taxation and the protectionist system these methods depend in part on brute force eg the colonial system but they all employ the power of the state the concentrated and organised force of society to hasten hothouse fashion the process of transformation of the feudal mode of production into the capitalist mode and to shorten the transition force is the midwife of every old society pregnant with a new one it is itself an economic power of the christian colonial system w howitt a man who makes a speciality of christianity says “the barbarities and desperate outrages of the socalled christian race throughout every region of the world and upon every people they have been able to subdue are not to be paralleled by those of any other race however fierce however untaught and however reckless of mercy and of shame in any age of the earth” the history of the colonial administration of holland – and holland was the head capitalistic nation of the th century – “is one of the most extraordinary relations of treachery bribery massacre and meanness” nothing is more characteristic than their system of stealing men to get slaves for java the men stealers were trained for this purpose the thief the interpreter and the seller were the chief agents in this trade native princes the chief sellers the young people stolen were thrown into the secret dungeons of celebes until they were ready for sending to the slaveships an official report says “this one town of macassar eg is full of secret prisons one more horrible than the other crammed with unfortunates victims of greed and tyranny fettered in chains forcibly torn from their families” to secure malacca the dutch corrupted the portuguese governor he let them into the town in they hurried at once to his house and assassinated him to “abstain” from the payment of £ the price of his treason wherever they set foot devastation and depopulation followed banjuwangi a province of java in numbered over inhabitants in only sweet commerce the english east india company as is well known obtained besides the political rule in india the exclusive monopoly of the teatrade as well as of the chinese trade in general and of the transport of goods to and from europe but the coasting trade of india and between the islands as well as the internal trade of india were the monopoly of the higher employés of the company the monopolies of salt opium betel and other commodities were inexhaustible mines of wealth the employés themselves fixed the price and plundered at will the unhappy hindus the governorgeneral took part in this private traffic his favourites received contracts under conditions whereby they cleverer than the alchemists made gold out of nothing great fortunes sprang up like mushrooms in a day primitive accumulation went on without the advance of a shilling the trial of warren hastings swarms with such cases here is an instance a contract for opium was given to a certain sullivan at the moment of his departure on an official mission to a part of india far removed from the opium district sullivan sold his contract to one binn for £ binn sold it the same day for £ and the ultimate purchaser who carried out the contract declared that after all he realised an enormous gain according to one of the lists laid before parliament the company and its employés from got £ from the indians as gifts between and the english manufactured a famine by buying up all the rice and refusing to sell it again except at fabulous prices the treatment of the aborigines was naturally most frightful in plantationcolonies destined for export trade only such as the west indies and in rich and wellpopulated countries such as mexico and india that were given over to plunder but even in the colonies properly so called the christian character of primitive accumulation did not belie itself those sober virtuosi of protestantism the puritans of new england in by decrees of their assembly set a premium of £ on every indian scalp and every captured redskin in a premium of £ on every scalp in after massachusettsbay had proclaimed a certain tribe as rebels the following prices for a male scalp of years and upwards £ new currency for a male prisoner £ for women and children prisoners £ for scalps of women and children £ some decades later the colonial system took its revenge on the descendants of the pious pilgrim fathers who had grown seditious in the meantime at english instigation and for english pay they were tomahawked by redskins the british parliament proclaimed bloodhounds and scalping as “means that god and nature had given into its hand” the colonial system ripened like a hothouse trade and navigation the “societies monopolia” of luther were powerful levers for concentration of capital the colonies secured a market for the budding manufactures and through the monopoly of the market an increased accumulation the treasures captured outside europe by undisguised looting enslavement and murder floated back to the mothercountry and were there turned into capital holland which first fully developed the colonial system in stood already in the acme of its commercial greatness it was “in almost exclusive possession of the east indian trade and the commerce between the southeast and northwest of europe its fisheries marine manufactures surpassed those of any other country the total capital of the republic was probably more important than that of all the rest of europe put together” gülich forgets to add that by the people of holland were more overworked poorer and more brutally oppressed than those of all the rest of europe put together today industrial supremacy implies commercial supremacy in the period of manufacture properly so called it is on the other hand the commercial supremacy that gives industrial predominance hence the preponderant rôle that the colonial system plays at that time it was “the strange god” who perched himself on the altar cheek by jowl with the old gods of europe and one fine day with a shove and a kick chucked them all of a heap it proclaimed surplusvalue making as the sole end and aim of humanity the system of public credit ie of national debts whose origin we discover in genoa and venice as early as the middle ages took possession of europe generally during the manufacturing period the colonial system with its maritime trade and commercial wars served as a forcinghouse for it thus it first took root in holland national debts ie the alienation of the state – whether despotic constitutional or republican – marked with its stamp the capitalistic era the only part of the socalled national wealth that actually enters into the collective possessions of modern peoples is their national debt hence as a necessary consequence the modern doctrine that a nation becomes the richer the more deeply it is in debt public credit becomes the credo of capital and with the rise of national debtmaking want of faith in the national debt takes the place of the blasphemy against the holy ghost which may not be forgiven the public debt becomes one of the most powerful levers of primitive accumulation as with the stroke of an enchanter’s wand it endows barren money with the power of breeding and thus turns it into capital without the necessity of its exposing itself to the troubles and risks inseparable from its employment in industry or even in usury the state creditors actually give nothing away for the sum lent is transformed into public bonds easily negotiable which go on functioning in their hands just as so much hard cash would but further apart from the class of lazy annuitants thus created and from the improvised wealth of the financiers middlemen between the government and the nation – as also apart from the taxfarmers merchants private manufacturers to whom a good part of every national loan renders the service of a capital fallen from heaven – the national debt has given rise to jointstock companies to dealings in negotiable effects of all kinds and to agiotage in a word to stockexchange gambling and the modern bankocracy at their birth the great banks decorated with national titles were only associations of private speculators who placed themselves by the side of governments and thanks to the privileges they received were in a position to advance money to the state hence the accumulation of the national debt has no more infallible measure than the successive rise in the stock of these banks whose full development dates from the founding of the bank of england in the bank of england began with lending its money to the government at at the same time it was empowered by parliament to coin money out of the same capital by lending it again to the public in the form of banknotes it was allowed to use these notes for discounting bills making advances on commodities and for buying the precious metals it was not long ere this creditmoney made by the bank itself became the coin in which the bank of england made its loans to the state and paid on account of the state the interest on the public debt it was not enough that the bank gave with one hand and took back more with the other it remained even whilst receiving the eternal creditor of the nation down to the last shilling advanced gradually it became inevitably the receptacle of the metallic hoard of the country and the centre of gravity of all commercial credit what effect was produced on their contemporaries by the sudden uprising of this brood of bankocrats financiers rentiers brokers stockjobbers c is proved by the writings of that time eg by bolingbroke’s with the national debt arose an international credit system which often conceals one of the sources of primitive accumulation in this or that people thus the villainies of the venetian thieving system formed one of the secret bases of the capitalwealth of holland to whom venice in her decadence lent large sums of money so also was it with holland and england by the beginning of the th century the dutch manufactures were far outstripped holland had ceased to be the nation preponderant in commerce and industry one of its main lines of business therefore from is the lending out of enormous amounts of capital especially to its great rival england the same thing is going on today between england and the united states a great deal of capital which appears today in the united states without any certificate of birth was yesterday in england the capitalised blood of children as the national debt finds its support in the public revenue which must cover the yearly payments for interest c the modern system of taxation was the necessary complement of the system of national loans the loans enable the government to meet extraordinary expenses without the taxpayers feeling it immediately but they necessitate as a consequence increased taxes on the other hand the raising of taxation caused by the accumulation of debts contracted one after another compels the government always to have recourse to new loans for new extraordinary expenses modern fiscality whose pivot is formed by taxes on the most necessary means of subsistence thereby increasing their price thus contains within itself the germ of automatic progression overtaxation is not an incident but rather a principle in holland therefore where this system was first inaugurated the great patriot dewitt has in his “maxims” extolled it as the best system for making the wage labourer submissive frugal industrious and overburdened with labour the destructive influence that it exercises on the condition of the wage labourer concerns us less however here than the forcible expropriation resulting from it of peasants artisans and in a word all elements of the lower middle class on this there are not two opinions even among the bourgeois economists its expropriating efficacy is still further heightened by the system of protection which forms one of its integral parts the great part that the public debt and the fiscal system corresponding with it has played in the capitalisation of wealth and the expropriation of the masses has led many writers like cobbett doubleday and others to seek in this incorrectly the fundamental cause of the misery of the modern peoples the system of protection was an artificial means of manufacturing manufacturers of expropriating independent labourers of capitalising the national means of production and subsistence of forcibly abbreviating the transition from the medieval to the modern mode of production the european states tore one another to pieces about the patent of this invention and once entered into the service of the surplusvalue makers did not merely lay under contribution in the pursuit of this purpose their own people indirectly through protective duties directly through export premiums they also forcibly rooted out in their dependent countries all industry as eg england did with the irish woollen manufacture on the continent of europe after colbert’s example the process was much simplified the primitive industrial capital here came in part directly out of the state treasury “why” cries mirabeau “why go so far to seek the cause of the manufacturing glory of saxony before the war of debts contracted by the sovereigns” colonial system public debts heavy taxes protection commercial wars c these children of the true manufacturing period increase gigantically during the infancy of modem industry the birth of the latter is heralded by a great slaughter of the innocents like the royal navy the factories were recruited by means of the pressgang blasé as sir f m eden is as to the horrors of the expropriation of the agricultural population from the soil from the last third of the th century to his own time with all the selfsatisfaction with which he rejoices in this process “essential” for establishing capitalistic agriculture and “the due proportion between arable and pasture land” – he does not show however the same economic insight in respect to the necessity of childstealing and childslavery for the transformation of manufacturing exploitation into factory exploitation and the establishment of the “true relation” between capital and labourpower he says “it may perhaps be worthy the attention of the public to consider whether any manufacture which in order to be carried on successfully requires that cottages and workhouses should be ransacked for poor children that they should be employed by turns during the greater part of the night and robbed of that rest which though indispensable to all is most required by the young and that numbers of both sexes of different ages and dispositions should be collected together in such a manner that the contagion of example cannot but lead to profligacy and debauchery will add to the sum of individual or national felicity” “in the counties of derbyshire nottinghamshire and more particularly in lancashire” says fielden “the newlyinvented machinery was used in large factories built on the sides of streams capable of turning the waterwheel thousands of hands were suddenly required in these places remote from towns and lancashire in particular being till then comparatively thinly populated and barren a population was all that she now wanted the small and nimble fingers of little children being by very far the most in request the custom instantly sprang up of procuring apprentices from the different parish workhouses of london birmingham and elsewhere many many thousands of these little hapless creatures were sent down into the north being from the age of to the age of or years old the custom was for the master to clothe his apprentices and to feed and lodge them in an “apprentice house” near the factory overseers were appointed to see to the works whose interest it was to work the children to the utmost because their pay was in proportion to the quantity of work that they could exact cruelty was of course the consequence in many of the manufacturing districts but particularly i am afraid in the guilty county to which i belong lancashire cruelties the most heartrending were practised upon the unoffending and friendless creatures who were thus consigned to the charge of mastermanufacturers they were harassed to the brink of death by excess of labour were flogged fettered and tortured in the most exquisite refinement of cruelty they were in many cases starved to the bone while flogged to their work and even in some instances were driven to commit suicide the beautiful and romantic valleys of derbyshire nottinghamshire and lancashire secluded from the public eye became the dismal solitudes of torture and of many a murder the profits of manufacturers were enormous but this only whetted the appetite that it should have satisfied and therefore the manufacturers had recourse to an expedient that seemed to secure to them those profits without any possibility of limit they began the practice of what is termed “nightworking” that is having tired one set of hands by working them throughout the day they had another set ready to go on working throughout the night the dayset getting into the beds that the nightset had just quitted and in their turn again the nightset getting into the beds that the dayset quitted in the morning it is a common tradition in lancashire that the beds never get cold” with the development of capitalist production during the manufacturing period the public opinion of europe had lost the last remnant of shame and conscience the nations bragged cynically of every infamy that served them as a means to capitalistic accumulation read eg the naïve annals of commerce of the worthy a anderson here it is trumpeted forth as a triumph of english statecraft that at the peace of utrecht england extorted from the spaniards by the asiento treaty the privilege of being allowed to ply the negro trade until then only carried on between africa and the english west indies between africa and spanish america as well england thereby acquired the right of supplying spanish america until with negroes yearly this threw at the same time an official cloak over british smuggling liverpool waxed fat on the slave trade this was its method of primitive accumulation and even to the present day liverpool “respectability” is the pindar of the slave trade which – compare the work of aikin already quoted – “has coincided with that spirit of bold adventure which has characterised the trade of liverpool and rapidly carried it to its present state of prosperity has occasioned vast employment for shipping and sailors and greatly augmented the demand for the manufactures of the country” p liverpool employed in the slavetrade in ships in in in and in whilst the cotton industry introduced childslavery in england it gave in the united states a stimulus to the transformation of the earlier more or less patriarchal slavery into a system of commercial exploitation in fact the veiled slavery of the wage workers in europe needed for its pedestal slavery pure and simple in the new world tantae molis erat to establish the “eternal laws of nature” of the capitalist mode of production to complete the process of separation between labourers and conditions of labour to transform at one pole the social means of production and subsistence into capital at the opposite pole the mass of the population into wage labourers into “free labouring poor” that artificial product of modern society if money according to augier “comes into the world with a congenital bloodstain on one cheek” capital comes dripping from head to foot from every pore with blood and dirt chapter historical tendency of capitalist accumulation what does the primitive accumulation of capital ie its historical genesis resolve itself into in so far as it is not immediate transformation of slaves and serfs into wage labourers and therefore a mere change of form it only means the expropriation of the immediate producers ie the dissolution of private property based on the labour of its owner private property as the antithesis to social collective property exists only where the means of labour and the external conditions of labour belong to private individuals but according as these private individuals are labourers or not labourers private property has a different character the numberless shades that it at first sight presents correspond to the intermediate stages lying between these two extremes the private property of the labourer in his means of production is the foundation of petty industry whether agricultural manufacturing or both petty industry again is an essential condition for the development of social production and of the free individuality of the labourer himself of course this petty mode of production exists also under slavery serfdom and other states of dependence but it flourishes it lets loose its whole energy it attains its adequate classical form only where the labourer is the private owner of his own means of labour set in action by himself the peasant of the land which he cultivates the artisan of the tool which he handles as a virtuoso this mode of production presupposes parcelling of the soil and scattering of the other means of production as it excludes the concentration of these means of production so also it excludes cooperation division of labour within each separate process of production the control over and the productive application of the forces of nature by society and the free development of the social productive powers it is compatible only with a system of production and a society moving within narrow and more or less primitive bounds to perpetuate it would be as pecqueur rightly says “to decree universal mediocrity at a certain stage of development it brings forth the material agencies for its own dissolution from that moment new forces and new passions spring up in the bosom of society but the old social organisation fetters them and keeps them down it must be annihilated it is annihilated its annihilation the transformation of the individualised and scattered means of production into socially concentrated ones of the pigmy property of the many into the huge property of the few the expropriation of the great mass of the people from the soil from the means of subsistence and from the means of labour this fearful and painful expropriation of the mass of the people forms the prelude to the history of capital it comprises a series of forcible methods of which we have passed in review only those that have been epochmaking as methods of the primitive accumulation of capital the expropriation of the immediate producers was accomplished with merciless vandalism and under the stimulus of passions the most infamous the most sordid the pettiest the most meanly odious selfearned private property that is based so to say on the fusing together of the isolated independent labouring individual with the conditions of his labour is supplanted by capitalistic private property which rests on exploitation of the nominally free labour of others ie on wage labour as soon as this process of transformation has sufficiently decomposed the old society from top to bottom as soon as the labourers are turned into proletarians their means of labour into capital as soon as the capitalist mode of production stands on its own feet then the further socialisation of labour and further transformation of the land and other means of production into socially exploited and therefore common means of production as well as the further expropriation of private proprietors takes a new form that which is now to be expropriated is no longer the labourer working for himself but the capitalist exploiting many labourers this expropriation is accomplished by the action of the immanent laws of capitalistic production itself by the centralisation of capital one capitalist always kills many hand in hand with this centralisation or this expropriation of many capitalists by few develop on an everextending scale the cooperative form of the labour process the conscious technical application of science the methodical cultivation of the soil the transformation of the instruments of labour into instruments of labour only usable in common the economising of all means of production by their use as means of production of combined socialised labour the entanglement of all peoples in the net of the world market and with this the international character of the capitalistic regime along with the constantly diminishing number of the magnates of capital who usurp and monopolise all advantages of this process of transformation grows the mass of misery oppression slavery degradation exploitation but with this too grows the revolt of the working class a class always increasing in numbers and disciplined united organised by the very mechanism of the process of capitalist production itself the monopoly of capital becomes a fetter upon the mode of production which has sprung up and flourished along with and under it centralisation of the means of production and socialisation of labour at last reach a point where they become incompatible with their capitalist integument this integument is burst asunder the knell of capitalist private property sounds the expropriators are expropriated the capitalist mode of appropriation the result of the capitalist mode of production produces capitalist private property this is the first negation of individual private property as founded on the labour of the proprietor but capitalist production begets with the inexorability of a law of nature its own negation it is the negation of negation this does not reestablish private property for the producer but gives him individual property based on the acquisition of the capitalist era ie on cooperation and the possession in common of the land and of the means of production the transformation of scattered private property arising from individual labour into capitalist private property is naturally a process incomparably more protracted violent and difficult than the transformation of capitalistic private property already practically resting on socialised production into socialised property in the former case we had the expropriation of the mass of the people by a few usurpers in the latter we have the expropriation of a few usurpers by the mass of the people chapter the modern theory of colonisation political economy confuses on principle two very different kinds of private property of which one rests on the producers’ own labour the other on the employment of the labour of others it forgets that the latter not only is the direct antithesis of the former but absolutely grows on its tomb only in western europe the home of political economy the process of primitive accumulation is more of less accomplished here the capitalist regime has either directly conquered the whole domain of national production or where economic conditions are less developed it at least indirectly controls those strata of society which though belonging to the antiquated mode of production continue to exist side by side with it in gradual decay to this readymade world of capital the political economist applies the notions of law and of property inherited from a precapitalistic world with all the more anxious zeal and all the greater unction the more loudly the facts cry out in the face of his ideology it is otherwise in the colonies there the capitalist regime everywhere comes into collision with the resistance of the producer who as owner of his own conditions of labour employs that labour to enrich himself instead of the capitalist the contradiction of these two diametrically opposed economic systems manifests itself here practically in a struggle between them where the capitalist has at his back the power of the mothercountry he tries to clear out of his way by force the modes of production and appropriation based on the independent labour of the producer the same interest which compels the sycophant of capital the political economist in the mothercountry to proclaim the theoretical identity of the capitalist mode of production with its contrary that same interest compels him in the colonies to make a clean breast of it and to proclaim aloud the antagonism of the two modes of production to this end he proves how the development of the social productive power of labour cooperation division of labour use of machinery on a large scale c are impossible without the expropriation of the labourers and the corresponding transformation of their means of production into capital in the interest of the socalled national wealth he seeks for artificial means to ensure the poverty of the people here his apologetic armor crumbles off bit by bit like rotten touchwood it is the great merit of eg wakefield to have discovered not anything new about the colonies but to have discovered in the colonies the truth as to the conditions of capitalist production in the mother country as the system of protection at its origin attempted to manufacture capitalists artificially in the mothercountry so wakefield’s colonisation theory which england tried for a time to enforce by acts of parliament attempted to effect the manufacture of wageworkers in the colonies this he calls “systematic colonisation” first of all wakefield discovered that in the colonies property in money means of subsistence machines and other means of production does not as yet stamp a man as a capitalist if there be wanting the correlative – the wageworker the other man who is compelled to sell himself of his own free will he discovered that capital is not a thing but a social relation between persons established by the instrumentality of things mr peel he moans took with him from england to swan river west australia means of subsistence and of production to the amount of £ mr peel had the foresight to bring with him besides persons of the working class men women and children once arrived at his destination “mr peel was left without a servant to make his bed or fetch him water from the river” unhappy mr peel who provided for everything except the export of english modes of production to swan river for the understanding of the following discoveries of wakefield two preliminary remarks we know that the means of production and subsistence while they remain the property of the immediate producer are not capital they become capital only under circumstances in which they serve at the same time as means of exploitation and subjection of the labourer but this capitalist soul of theirs is so intimately wedded in the head of the political economist to their material substance that he christens them capital under all circumstances even when they are its exact opposite thus is it with wakefield further the splitting up of the means of production into the individual property of many independent labourers working on their own account he calls equal division of capital it is with the political economist as with the feudal jurist the latter stuck on to pure monetary relations the labels supplied by feudal law “if” says wakefield “all members of the society are supposed to possess equal portions of capital no man would have a motive for accumulating more capital than he could use with his own hands this is to some extent the case in new american settlements where a passion for owning land prevents the existence of a class of labourers for hire” so long therefore as the labourer can accumulate for himself – and this he can do so long as he remains possessor of his means of production – capitalist accumulation and the capitalistic mode of production are impossible the class of wage labourers essential to these is wanting how then in old europe was the expropriation of the labourer from his conditions of labour ie the coexistence of capital and wage labour brought about by a social contract of a quite original kind “mankind have adopted a simple contrivance for promoting the accumulation of capital” which of course since the time of adam floated in their imagination floated in their imagination as the sole and final end of their existence “they have divided themselves into owners of capital and owners of labour the division was the result of concert and combination” in one word the mass of mankind expropriated itself in honour of the “accumulation of capital” now one would think that this instinct of selfdenying fanaticism would give itself full fling especially in the colonies where alone exist the men and conditions that could turn a social contract from a dream to a reality but why then should “systematic colonisation” be called in to replace its opposite spontaneous unregulated colonisation but but “in the northern states of the american union it may be doubted whether so many as a tenth of the people would fall under the description of hired labourers in england the labouring class compose the bulk of the people” nay the impulse to selfexpropriation on the part of labouring humanity for the glory of capital exists so little that slavery according to wakefield himself is the sole natural basis of colonial wealth his systematic colonisation is a mere pis aller since he unfortunately has to do with free men not with slaves “the first spanish settlers in saint domingo did not obtain labourers from spain but without labourers their capital must have perished or at least must soon have been diminished to that small amount which each individual could employ with his own hands this has actually occurred in the last colony founded by england – the swan river settlement – where a great mass of capital of seeds implements and cattle has perished for want of labourers to use it and where no settler has preserved much more capital than he can employ with his own hands” we have seen that the expropriation of the mass of the people from the soil forms the basis of the capitalist mode of production the essence of a free colony on the contrary consists in this – that the bulk of the soil is still public property and every settler on it therefore can turn part of it into his private property and individual means of production without hindering the later settlers in the same operation this is the secret both of the prosperity of the colonies and of their inveterate vice – opposition to the establishment of capital “where land is very cheap and all men are free where every one who so pleases can easily obtain a piece of land for himself not only is labour very dear as respects the labourer’s share of the produce but the difficulty is to obtain combined labour at any price” as in the colonies the separation of the labourer from the conditions of labour and their root the soil does not exist or only sporadically or on too limited a scale so neither does the separation of agriculture from industry exist nor the destruction of the household industry of the peasantry whence then is to come the internal market for capital “no part of the population of america is exclusively agricultural excepting slaves and their employers who combine capital and labour in particular works free americans who cultivate the soil follow many other occupations some portion of the furniture and tools which they use is commonly made by themselves they frequently build their own houses and carry to market at whatever distance the produce of their own industry they are spinners and weavers they make soap and candles as well as in many cases shoes and clothes for their own use in america the cultivation of land is often the secondary pursuit of a blacksmith a miller or a shopkeeper” with such queer people as these where is the “field of abstinence” for the capitalists the great beauty of capitalist production consists in this – that it not only constantly reproduces the wageworker as wageworker but produces always in proportion to the accumulation of capital a relative surpluspopulation of wageworkers thus the law of supply and demand of labour is kept in the right rut the oscillation of wages is penned within limits satisfactory to capitalist exploitation and lastly the social dependence of the labourer on the capitalist that indispensable requisite is secured an unmistakable relation of dependence which the smug political economist at home in the mothercountry can transmogrify into one of free contract between buyer and seller between equally independent owners of commodities the owner of the commodity capital and the owner of the commodity labour but in the colonies this pretty fancy is torn asunder the absolute population here increases much more quickly than in the mothercountry because many labourers enter this world as readymade adults and yet the labourmarket is always understocked the law of supply and demand of labour falls to pieces on the one hand the old world constantly throws in capital thirsting after exploitation and “abstinence” on the other the regular reproduction of the wage labourer as wage labourer comes into collision with impediments the most impertinent and in part invincible what becomes of the production of wagelabourers supernumerary in proportion to the accumulation of capital the wageworker of today is tomorrow an independent peasant or artisan working for himself he vanishes from the labourmarket but not into the workhouse this constant transformation of the wagelabourers into independent producers who work for themselves instead of for capital and enrich themselves instead of the capitalist gentry reacts in its turn very perversely on the conditions of the labourmarket not only does the degree of exploitation of the wage labourer remain indecently low the wage labourer loses into the bargain along with the relation of dependence also the sentiment of dependence on the abstemious capitalist hence all the inconveniences that our e g wakefield pictures so doughtily so eloquently so pathetically the supply of wage labour he complains is neither constant nor regular nor sufficient “the supply of labour is always not only small but uncertain” “though the produce divided between the capitalist and the labourer be large the labourer takes so great a share that he soon becomes a capitalist few even those whose lives are unusually long can accumulate great masses of wealth” the labourers most distinctly decline to allow the capitalist to abstain from the payment of the greater part of their labour it avails him nothing if he is so cunning as to import from europe with his own capital his own wageworkers they soon “cease to be labourers for hire they become independent landowners if not competitors with their former masters in the labourmarket” think of the horror the excellent capitalist has imported bodily from europe with his own good money his own competitors the end of the world has come no wonder wakefield laments the absence of all dependence and of all sentiment of dependence on the part of the wageworkers in the colonies on account of the high wages says his disciple merivale there is in the colonies “the urgent desire for cheaper and more subservient labourers – for a class to whom the capitalist might dictate terms instead of being dictated to by them in ancient civilised countries the labourer though free is by a law of nature dependent on capitalists in colonies this dependence must be created by artificial means” what is now according to wakefield the consequence of this unfortunate state of things in the colonies a “barbarising tendency of dispersion” of producers and national wealth the parcellingout of the means of production among innumerable owners working on their own account annihilates along with the centralisation of capital all the foundation of combined labour every longwinded undertaking extending over several years and demanding outlay of fixed capital is prevented from being carried out in europe capital invests without hesitating a moment for the working class constitutes its living appurtenance always in excess always at disposal but in the colonies wakefield tells an extremely doleful anecdote he was talking with some capitalists of canada and the state of new york where the immigrant wave often becomes stagnant and deposits a sediment of “supernumerary” labourers “our capital” says one of the characters in the melodrama was ready for many operations which require a considerable period of time for their completion but we could not begin such operations with labour which we knew would soon leave us if we had been sure of retaining the labour of such emigrants we should have been glad to have engaged it at once and for a high price and we should have engaged it even though we had been sure it would leave us provided we had been sure of a fresh supply whenever we might need it” after wakefield has constructed the english capitalist agriculture and its “combined” labour with the scattered cultivation of american peasants he unwittingly gives us a glimpse at the reverse of the medal he depicts the mass of the american people as welltodo independent enterprising and comparatively cultured whilst “the english agricultural labourer is miserable wretch a pauper in what country except north america and some new colonies do the wages of free labour employed in agriculture much exceed a bare subsistence for the labourer undoubtedly farmhorses in england being a valuable property are better fed than english peasants” but never mind national wealth is once again by its very nature identical with misery of the people how then to heal the anticapitalistic cancer of the colonies if men were willing at a blow to turn all the soil from public into private property they would destroy certainly the root of the evil but also – the colonies the trick is how to kill two birds with one stone let the government put upon the virgin soil an artificial price independent of the law of supply and demand a price that compels the immigrant to work a long time for wages before he can earn enough money to buy land and turn himself into an independent peasant the fund resulting from the sale of land at a price relatively prohibitory for the wageworkers this fund of money extorted from the wages of labour by violation of the sacred law of supply and demand the government is to employ on the other hand in proportion as it grows to import havenothings from europe into the colonies and thus keep the wage labour market full for the capitalists under these circumstances tout sera pour le mieux dans le meilleur des mondes possibles this is the great secret of “systematic colonisation” by this plan wakefield cries in triumph “the supply of labour must be constant and regular because first as no labourer would be able to procure land until he had worked for money all immigrant labourers working for a time for wages and in combination would produce capital for the employment of more labourers secondly because every labourer who left off working for wages and became a landowner would by purchasing land provide a fund for bringing fresh labour to the colony” the price of the soil imposed by the state must of course be a “sufficient price” – ie so high “as to prevent the labourers from becoming independent landowners until others had followed to take their place” this “sufficient price for the land” is nothing but a euphemistic circumlocution for the ransom which the labourer pays to the capitalist for leave to retire from the wage labour market to the land first he must create for the capitalist “capital” with which the latter may be able to exploit more labourers then he must place at his own expense a locum tenens placeholder on the labour market whom the government forwards across the sea for the benefit of his old master the capitalist it is very characteristic that the english government for years practised this method of “primitive accumulation” prescribed by mr wakefield expressly for the use of the colonies the fiasco was of course as complete as that of sir robert peel’s bank act the stream of emigration was only diverted from the english colonies to the united states meanwhile the advance of capitalistic production in europe accompanied by increasing government pressure has rendered wakefield’s recipe superfluous on the one hand the enormous and ceaseless stream of men year after year driven upon america leaves behind a stationary sediment in the east of the united states the wave of immigration from europe throwing men on the labourmarket there more rapidly than the wave of emigration westwards can wash them away on the other hand the american civil war brought in its train a colossal national debt and with it pressure of taxes the rise of the vilest financial aristocracy the squandering of a huge part of the public land on speculative companies for the exploitation of railways mines c in brief the most rapid centralisation of capital the great republic has therefore ceased to be the promised land for emigrant labourers capitalistic production advances there with giant strides even though the lowering of wages and the dependence of the wageworker are yet far from being brought down to the normal european level the shameless lavishing of uncultivated colonial land on aristocrats and capitalists by the government so loudly denounced even by wakefield has produced especially in australia in conjunction with the stream of men that the gold diggings attract and with the competition that the importation of englishcommodities causes even to the smallest artisan an ample “relative surplus labouring population” so that almost every mail brings the job’s news of a “glut of the australia labourmarket” and the prostitution in some places flourishes as wantonly as in the london haymarket however we are not concerned here with the conditions of the colonies the only thing that interests us is the secret discovered in the new world by the political economy of the old world and proclaimed on the housetops that the capitalist mode of production and accumulation and therefore capitalist private property have for their fundamental condition the annihilation of selfearned private property in other words the expropriation of the labourer end of book i the following passage occurred only in the first edition “now we know the substance of value it is labour we know the

moderna t xv p comp hegel “philosophie des rechts” berlin p the reader must note that we are not speaking here of the wages or value that the labourer gets for a given labour time but of the value of the commodity in which that labour time is materialised wages is a category that as yet has no existence at the present stage of our investigation in order to prove that labour alone is that allsufficient and real measure by which at all times the value of all commodities can be estimated and compared adam smith says “equal quantities of labour must at all times and in all places have the same value for the labourer in his normal state of health strength and activity and with the average degree of skill that he may possess he must always give up the same portion of his rest his freedom and his happiness” “wealth of nations” b i ch v on the one hand adam smith here but not everywhere confuses the determination of value by means of the quantity of labour expended in the production of commodities with the determination of the values of commodities by means of the value of labour and seeks in consequence to prove that equal quantities of labour have always the same value on the other hand he has a presentiment that labour so far as it manifests itself in the value of commodities counts only as expenditure of labour power but he treats this expenditure as the mere sacrifice of rest freedom and happiness not as at the same time the normal activity of living beings but then he has the modern wagelabourer in his eye much more aptly the anonymous predecessor of adam smith quoted above in note this chapter says “one man has employed himself a week in providing this necessary of life and he that gives him some other in exchange cannot make a better estimate of what is a proper equivalent than by computing what cost him just as much labour and time which in effect is no more than exchanging one man’s labour in one thing for a time certain for another man’s labour in another thing for the same time” lc p the english language has the advantage of possessing different words for the two aspects of labour here considered the labour which creates use value and counts qualitatively is work as distinguished from labour that which creates value and counts quantitatively is labour as distinguished from work engels the few economists amongst whom is s bailey who have occupied themselves with the analysis of the form of value have been unable to arrive at any result first because they confuse the form of value with value itself and second because under the coarse influence of the practical bourgeois they exclusively give their attention to the quantitative aspect of the question “the command of quantity constitutes value” “money and its vicissitudes” london p by s bailey the celebrated franklin one of the first economists after wm petty who saw through the nature of value says “trade in general being nothing else but the exchange of labour for labour the value of all things is most justly measured by labour” “the works of b franklin c” edited by sparks boston vol ii p franklin is unconscious that by estimating the value of everything in labour he makes abstraction from any difference in the sorts of labour exchanged and thus reduces them all to equal human labour but although ignorant of this yet he says it he speaks first of “the one labour” then of “the other labour” and finally of “labour” without further qualification as the substance of the value of everything in a sort of way it is with man as with commodities since he comes into the world neither with a looking glass in his hand nor as a fichtian philosopher to whom “i am i” is sufficient man first sees and recognises himself in other men peter only establishes his own identity as a man by first comparing himself with paul as being of like kind and thereby paul just as he stands in his pauline personality becomes to peter the type of the genus homo value is here as occasionally in the preceding pages used in sense of value determined as to quantity or of magnitude of value this incongruity between the magnitude of value and its relative expression has with customary ingenuity been exploited by vulgar economists for example – “once admit that a falls because b with which it is exchanged rises while no less labour is bestowed in the meantime on a and your general principle of value falls to the ground if he ricardo allowed that when a rises in value relatively to b b falls in value relatively to a he cut away the ground on which he rested his grand proposition that the value of a commodity is ever determined by the labour embodied in it for if a change in the cost of a alters not only its own value in relation to b for which it is exchanged but also the value of b relatively to that of a though no change has taken place in the quantity of labour to produce b then not only the doctrine falls to the ground which asserts that the quantity of labour bestowed on an article regulates its value but also that which affirms the cost of an article to regulate its value’ j broadhurst “political economy” london pp and mr broadhurst might just as well say consider the fractions c the number remains unchanged and yet its proportional magnitude its magnitude relatively to the numbers c continually diminishes therefore the great principle that the magnitude of a whole number such as is “regulated” by the number of times unity is contained in it falls to the ground the author explains in section of this chapter pp note note of this document

dissertation on the nature measures and causes of value chiefly in reference to the writings of mr ricardo and his followers” by the author of “essays on the formation c of opinions” london p s bailey the author of this anonymous work a work which in its day created much stir in england fancied that by thus pointing out the various relative expressions of one and the same value he had proved the impossibility of any determination of the concept of value however narrow his own views may have been yet that he laid his finger on some serious defects in the ricardian theory is proved by the animosity with which he was attacked by ricardo’s followers see the westminster review for example it is by no means selfevident that this character of direct and universal exchangeability is so to speak a polar one and as intimately connected with its opposite pole the absence of direct exchangeability as the positive pole of the magnet is with its negative counterpart it may therefore be imagined that all commodities can simultaneously have this character impressed upon them just as it can be imagined that all catholics can be popes together it is of course highly desirable in the eyes of the petit bourgeois for whom the production of commodities is the nec plus ultra of human freedom and individual independence that the inconveniences resulting from this character of commodities not being directly exchangeable should be removed proudhon’s socialism is a working out of this philistine utopia a form of socialism which as i have elsewhere shown does not possess even the merit of originality long before his time the task was attempted with much better success by gray bray and others but for all that wisdom of this kind flourishes even now in certain circles under the name of “science” never has any school played more tricks with the word science than that of proudhon for “wo begriffe fehlen da stellt zur rechten zeit ein wort sich ein” “where thoughts are absent words are brought in as convenient replacements” goethe’s faust see proudhon’s philosophy of poverty a in the german edition there is the following footnote here “one may recall that china and

“la ricchezza e una ragione tra due persone” – he ought to have added a relation between persons expressed as a relation between things galiani della moneta p v iii of custodi’s collection of “scrittori classici italiani di economia politica” parte moderna milano “what are we to think of a law that asserts itself only by periodical revolutions it is just nothing but a law of nature founded on the want of knowledge of those whose action is the subject of it” friedrich engels “umrisse zu einer kritik der nationalökonomie” in the “deutschfranzösische jahrbücher” edited by arnold ruge and karl marx paris even ricardo has his stories à la robinson “he makes the primitive hunter and the primitive fisher straightway as owners of commodities exchange fish and game in the proportion in which labour time is incorporated in these exchange values on this occasion he commits the anachronism of making these men apply to the calculation so far as their implements have to be taken into account the annuity tables in current use on the london exchange in the year the parallelograms of mr owen appear to be the only form of society besides the bourgeois form with which he was acquainted” karl marx “zur kritik c” pp a ridiculous presumption has latterly got abroad that common property in its primitive form is specifically a slavonian or even exclusively russian form it is the primitive form that we can prove to have existed amongst romans teutons and celts and even to this day we find numerous examples ruins though they be in india a more exhaustive study of asiatic and especially of indian forms of common property would show how from the different forms of primitive common property different forms of its dissolution have been developed thus for instance the various original types of roman and teutonic private property are deducible from different forms of indian common property” karl marx “zur kritik c” p the insufficiency of ricardo’s analysis of the magnitude of value and his analysis is by far the best will appear from the rd and th books of this work as regards value in general it is the weak point of the classical school of political economy that it nowhere expressly and with full consciousness distinguishes between labour as it appears in the value of a product and the same labour as it appears in the use value of that product of course the distinction is practically made since this school treats labour at one time under its quantitative aspect at another under its qualitative aspect but it has not the least idea that when the difference between various kinds of labour is treated as purely quantitative their qualitative unity or equality and therefore their reduction to abstract human labour is implied for instance ricardo declares that he agrees with destutt de tracy in this proposition “as it is certain that our physical and moral faculties are alone our original riches the employment of those faculties labour of some kind is our only original treasure and it is always from this employment that all those things are created which we call riches it is certain too that all those things only represent the labour which has created them and if they have a value or even two distinct values they can only derive them from that the value of the labour from which they emanate” ricardo “the principles of pol econ” ed lond p we would here only point out that ricardo puts his own more profound interpretation upon the words of destutt what the latter really says is that on the one hand all things which constitute wealth represent the labour that creates them but that on the other hand they acquire their “two different values” use value and exchange value from “the value of labour” he thus falls into the commonplace error of the vulgar economists who assume the value of one commodity in this case labour in order to determine the values of the rest but ricardo reads him as if he had said that labour not the value of labour is embodied both in use value and exchange value nevertheless ricardo himself pays so little attention to the twofold character of the labour which has a twofold embodiment that he devotes the whole of his chapter on “value and riches their distinctive properties” to a laborious examination of the trivialities of a jb say and at the finish he is quite astonished to find that destutt on the one hand agrees with him as to labour being the source of value and on the other hand with j b say as to the notion of value it is one of the chief failings of classical economy that it has never succeeded by means of its analysis of commodities and in particular of their value in discovering that form under which value becomes exchange value even adam smith and ricardo the best representatives of the school treat the form of value as a thing of no importance as having no connection with the inherent nature of commodities the reason for this is not solely because their attention is entirely absorbed in the analysis of the magnitude of value it lies deeper the value form of the product of labour is not only the most abstract but is also the most universal form taken by the product in bourgeois production and stamps that production as a particular species of social production and thereby gives it its special historical character if then we treat this mode of production as one eternally fixed by nature for every state of society we necessarily overlook that which is the differentia specifica of the value form and consequently of the commodity form and of its further developments money form capital form c we consequently find that economists who are thoroughly agreed as to labour time being the measure of the magnitude of value have the most strange and contradictory ideas of money the perfected form of the general equivalent this is seen in a striking manner when they treat of banking where the commonplace definitions of money will no longer hold water this led to the rise of a restored mercantile system ganilh c which sees in value nothing but a social form or rather the unsubstantial ghost of that form once for all i may here state that by classical political economy i understand that economy which since the time of w petty has investigated the real relations of production in bourgeois society in contradistinction to vulgar economy which deals with appearances only ruminates without ceasing on the materials long since provided by scientific economy and there seeks plausible explanations of the most obtrusive phenomena for bourgeois daily use but for the rest confines itself to systematising in a pedantic way and proclaiming for everlasting truths the trite ideas held by the selfcomplacent bourgeoisie with regard to their own world to them the best of all possible worlds “les économistes ont une singulière manière de procéder il n’y a pour eux que deux sortes d’institutions celles de l’art et celles de la nature les institutions de la féodalité sont des institutions artificielles celles de la bourgeoisie sont des institutions naturelles ils ressemblent en ceci aux théologiens qui eux aussi établissent deux sortes de religions toute religion qui n’est pas la leur est une invention des hommes tandis que leur propre religion est une émanation de dieu ‒ ainsi il y a eu de l’histoire mais il n’y en a plus” “economists have a singular method of procedure there are only two kinds of institutions for them artificial and natural the institutions of feudalism are artificial institutions those of the bourgeoisie are natural institutions in this they resemble the theologians who likewise establish two kinds of religion every religion which is not theirs is an invention of men while their own is an emanation from god thus there has been history but there is no longer any” karl marx misère de la philosophie réponse a la philosophie de la misère par m proudhon p truly comical is m bastiat who imagines that the ancient greeks and romans lived by plunder alone but when people plunder for centuries there must always be something at hand for them to seize the objects of plunder must be continually reproduced it would thus appear that even greeks and romans had some process of production consequently an economy which just as much constituted the material basis of their world as bourgeois economy constitutes that of our modern world or perhaps bastiat means that a mode of production based on slavery is based on a system of plunder in that case he treads on dangerous ground if a giant thinker like aristotle erred in his appreciation of slave labour why should a dwarf economist like bastiat be right in his appreciation of wage labour i seize this opportunity of shortly answering an objection taken by a german paper in america to my work “zur kritik der pol oekonomie ” in the estimation of that paper my view that each special mode of production and the social relations corresponding to it in short that the economic structure of society is the real basis on which the juridical and political superstructure is raised and to which definite social forms of thought correspond that the mode of production determines the character of the social political and intellectual life generally all this is very true for our own times in which material interests preponderate but not for the middle ages in which catholicism nor for athens and rome where politics reigned supreme in the first place it strikes one as an odd thing for any one to suppose that these wellworn phrases about the middle ages and the ancient world are unknown to anyone else this much however is clear that the middle ages could not live on catholicism nor the ancient world on politics on the contrary it is the mode in which they gained a livelihood that explains why here politics and there catholicism played the chief part for the rest it requires but a slight acquaintance with the history of the roman republic for example to be aware that its secret history is the history of its landed property on the other hand don quixote long ago paid the penalty for wrongly imagining that knight errantry was compatible with all economic forms of society “observations on certain verbal disputes in pol econ particularly relating to value and to demand and supply” lond p s bailey lc p the author of “observations” and s bailey accuse ricardo of converting exchange value from something relative into something absolute the opposite is the fact he has explained the apparent relation between objects such as diamonds and pearls in which relation they appear as exchange values and disclosed the true relation hidden behind the appearances namely their relation to each other as mere expressions of human labour if the followers of ricardo answer bailey somewhat rudely and by no means convincingly the reason is to be sought in this that they were unable to find in ricardo’s own works any key to the hidden relations existing between value and its form exchange value in the th century so renowned for its piety they included amongst commodities some very delicate things thus a french poet of the period enumerates amongst the goods to be found in the market of landit not only clothing shoes leather agricultural implements c but also “femmes folles de leur corps” proudhon begins by taking his ideal of justice of “justice éternelle” from the juridical relations that correspond to the production of commodities thereby it may be noted he proves to the consolation of all good citizens that the production of commodities is a form of production as everlasting as justice then he turns round and seeks to reform the actual production of commodities and the actual legal system corresponding thereto in accordance with this ideal what opinion should we have of a chemist who instead of studying the actual laws of the molecular changes in the composition and decomposition of matter and on that foundation solving definite problems claimed to regulate the composition and decomposition of matter by means of the “eternal ideas” of “naturalité” and “affinité” do we really know any more about “usury” when we say it contradicts “justice éternelle” “équité éternelle” “mutualité éternelle” and other “vérités éternelles” than the fathers of the church did when they said it was incompatible with “grâce éternelle” “foi éternelle” and “la volonté éternelle de dieu” for twofold is the use of every object the one is peculiar to the object as such the other is not as a sandal which may be worn and is also exchangeable both are uses of the sandal for even he who exchanges the sandal for the money or food he is in want of makes use of the sandal as a sandal but not in its natural way for it has not been made for the sake of being exchanged” aristoteles “de rep” l i c from this we may form an estimate of the shrewdness of the petitbourgeois socialism which while perpetuating the production of commodities aims at abolishing the “antagonism” between money and commodities and consequently since money exists only by virtue of this antagonism at abolishing money itself we might just as well try to retain catholicism without the pope for more on this point see my work “zur kritik der pol oekon” p sq so long as instead of two distinct usevalues

debase the coinage during the whole of the middle ages by the traditions of the roman empire and the conceptions of money to be found in the pandects “qu’aucun puisse ni doive faire doute” “let no one call into question” says an apt scholar of theirs philip of valois in a decree of “que à nous et à notre majesté royale n’appartiennent seulement le mestier le fait l’état la provision et toute

belongs exclusively to us and to our royal majesty to fix such a rate and at such price as it shall please us and seem good to us” it was a maxim of the roman law that the value of money was fixed by decree of the emperor it was expressly forbidden to treat money as a commodity “pecunias vero nulli emere fas erit nam in usu publico constitutas oportet non esse mercem” “however it shall not be lawful to anyone to buy money for as it was created for public use it is not permissible for it to be a commodity” some good work on this question has been done by g f pagnini “saggio sopra il giusto

earth in peru in the same time that he can produce a bushel of corn then the one is the natural price of the other now if by reason of new or more easier mines a man can procure two ounces of silver

the learned professor roscher after first informing us that “the false definitions of money may be divided into two main groups those which make it more and those which make it less than a commodity” gives us a long and very mixed catalogue of works on the nature of money from which it appears that he has not the remotest idea of the real history of the theory and then he moralises thus “for the rest it is not to be denied that most of the later economists do not bear sufficiently in mind the peculiarities that distinguish money from other commodities” it is then after all either more or less than a commodity “so far the semimercantilist reaction of ganilh is not altogether without foundation” wilhelm roscher “die grundlagen der nationaloekonomie” rd edn pp more less not sufficiently so far not altogether what clearness and precision of ideas and language and such eclectic professorial twaddle is modestly baptised by mr roscher “the anatomicophysiological method” of political economy one discovery however he must have credit for namely that money is “a pleasant commodity” the question — why does not money directly represent labourtime so that a piece of paper may represent for instance x hours’ labour is at bottom the same as the question why given the production of commodities must products take the form of commodities this is evident since their taking the form of commodities implies their differentiation into commodities and money or why cannot private labour — labour for the account of private individuals — be treated as its opposite immediate social labour i have elsewhere examined thoroughly the utopian idea of “labourmoney” in a society founded on the production of commodities l c p seq on this point i will only say further that owen’s “labourmoney” for instance is no more “money” than a ticket for the theatre owen presupposes directly associated labour a form of production that is entirely inconsistent with the production of commodities the certificate of labour is merely evidence of the part taken by the individual in the common labour and of his right to a certain portion of the common produce destined for consumption but it never enters into owen’s head to presuppose the production of commodities and at the same time by juggling with money to try to evade the necessary conditions of that production savages and halfcivilised races use the tongue differently captain parry says of the inhabitants on the west coast of baffin’s bay “in this case he refers to barter they licked it the thing represented to them twice to their tongues after which they seemed to consider the bargain satisfactorily concluded” in the same way the eastern esquimaux licked the articles they received in exchange if the tongue is thus used in the north as the organ of appropriation no wonder that in the south the stomach serves as the organ of accumulated property and that a kaffir estimates the wealth of a man by the size of his belly that the kaffirs know what they are about is shown by the following at the same time that the official british health report of disclosed the deficiency of fatforming food among a large part of the workingclass a certain dr harvey not however the celebrated discoverer of the circulation of the blood made a good thing by advertising recipes for reducing the superfluous fat of the bourgeoisie and aristocracy see karl marx “zur kritik c” “theorien von der masseinheit des geldes” p seq “wherever gold and silver have by law been made to perform the function of money or of a measure of value side by side it has always been tried but in vain to treat them as one and the same material to assume that there is an invariable ratio between the quantities of gold and silver in which a given quantity of labourtime is incorporated is to assume in fact that gold and silver are of one and the same material and that a given mass of the less valuable metal silver is a constant fraction of a given mass of gold from the reign of edward iii to the time of george ii the history of money in england consists of one long series of perturbations caused by the clashing of the legally fixed ratio between the values of gold and silver with the fluctuations in their real values at one time gold was too high at another silver the metal that for the time being was estimated below its value was withdrawn from circulation mated and exported the ratio between the two metals was then again altered by law but the new nominal ratio soon came into conflict again with the real one in our own times the slight and transient fall in the value of gold compared with silver which was a consequence of the indochinese demand for silver produced on a far more extended scale in france the same phenomena export of silver and its expulsion from circulation by gold during the years and the excess in france of goldimports over goldexports amounted to £ while the excess of silverexports over silverimports was £ in fact in those countries in which both metals are legally measures of value and therefore both legal tender so that everyone has the option of paying in either metal the metal that rises in value is at a premium and like every other commodity measures its price in the overestimated metal which alone serves in reality as the standard of value the result of all experience and history with regard to this equation is simply that where two commodities perform by law the functions of a measure of value in practice one alone maintains that position” karl marx lc pp the peculiar circumstance that while the ounce of gold serves in england as the unit of the standard of money the pound sterling does not form an aliquot part of it has been explained as follows “our coinage was originally adapted to the employment of silver only hence an ounce of silver can always be divided into a certain adequate number of pieces of coin but as gold was introduced at a later period into a coinage adapted only to silver an ounce of gold cannot be coined into an aliquot number of pieces” maclaren “a sketch of the history of the currency” london p with english writers the confusion between measure of value and standard of price standard of value is indescribable their functions as well as their names are constantly interchanged moreover it has not general historical validity it is thus that the pound sterling in english denotes less than onethird of its original weight the pound scot before the union only th the french livre th the spanish maravedi less than th and the portuguese rei a still smaller fraction “le monete le quali oggi sono ideal sono le piû antiche d’ogni nazione e tutte furono un tempo real e perche erano reali con esse si contava” “the coins which today are ideal are the oldest coins of every nation and all of them were once real and precisely because they were real they were used for calculation” galiani della moneta lc p david urquhart remarks in his “familiar words” on the monstrosity that nowadays a pound sterling which is the unit of the english standard of money is equal to about a quarter of an ounce of gold “this is falsifying a measure not establishing a standard” he sees in this “false denomination” of the weight of gold as in everything else the falsifying hand of civilisation when anacharsis was asked for what purposes the greeks used money he replied “for reckoning” ashen deipn iv v ed schweighauser “owing to the fact that money when serving as the standard of price appears under the same reckoning names as do the prices of commodities and that therefore the sum of £ s d may signify on the one hand an ounce weight of gold and on the other the value of a ton of iron this reckoning name of money has been called its mintprice hence there sprang up the extraordinary notion that the value of gold is estimated in its own material and that in contradistinction to all other commodities its price is fixed by the state it was erroneously thought that the giving of reckoning names to definite weights of gold is the same thing as fixing the value of those weights” karl marx lc p see “theorien von der masseinheit des geldes” in “zur kritik der pol oekon c” p seq the fantastic notions about raising or lowering the mintprice of money by transferring to greater or smaller weights of gold or silver the names already legally appropriated to fixed weights of those metals such notions at least in those cases in which they aim not at clumsy financial operations against creditors both public and private but at economic quack remedies have been so exhaustively treated by wm petty in his “quantulumcunque concerning money to the lord marquis of halifax ” that even his immediate followers sir dudley north and john locke not to mention later ones could only dilute him “if the wealth of a nation” he remarks “could be decupled by a proclamation it were strange that such proclamations have not long since been

james mill in “zur kritik c” pp with regard to this subject we may notice two methods characteristic of apologetic economy the first is the identification of the circulation of commodities with the direct barter of products by simple abstraction from their points of difference the second is the attempt to explain away the contradictions of capitalist production by reducing the relations between the persons engaged in that mode of production to the simple relations arising out of the circulation of commodities the production and circulation of commodities are however phenomena that occur to a greater or less extent in modes of production the most diverse if we are acquainted with nothing but the abstract categories of circulation which are common to all these modes of production we cannot possibly know anything of the specific points of difference of those modes nor pronounce any judgment upon them in no science is such a big fuss made with commonplace truisms as in political economy for instance j b say sets himself up as a judge of crises because forsooth he knows that a commodity is a product translator’s note — this word is here used in its original signification of the course or track pursued by money as it changes from hand to hand a course which essentially differs from circulation even when the commodity is sold over and over again a phenomenon that at present has no existence for us it falls when definitely sold for the last time out of the sphere of circulation into that of consumption where it serves either as means of subsistence or means of production “il l’argent n’a d’autre mouvement que celui qui lui est imprimé par les productions” “it” money “has no other motion than that imparted to it by the products” le trosne lc p “ce sont les productions qui le l’argent mettent en mouvement et le font circuler la célérité de son mouvement c de l’argent supplée à sa quantité lorsqu’il en est besoin il ne fait que glisser d’une main dans l’autre sans s’arrêter un instant” “it is products which set it” money “in motion and make it circulate the velocity of its” money’s “motion supplements its quantity when necessary it does nothing but slide from hand to hand without stopping for a moment” le trosne lc pp “money being the common measure of buying and selling everybody who hath anything to sell and cannot procure chapmen for it is presently apt to think that want of money in the kingdom or country is the cause why his goods do not go off and so want of money is the common cry which is a great mistake what do these people want who cry out for money the farmer complains he thinks that were more money in the country he should have a price for his goods then it seems money is not his want but a price for his corn and cattel which he would sell but cannot why cannot he get a price either there is too much corn and cattel in the country so that most who come to market have need of selling as he hath and few of buying or there wants the usual vent abroad by transportation or the consumption fails as when men by reason of poverty do not spend so much in their houses as formerly they did wherefore it is not the increase of specific money which would at all advance the farmer’s goods but the removal of any of these three causes which do truly keep down the market the merchant and shopkeeper want money in the same manner that is they want a vent for the goods they deal in by reason that the markets fail” a nation “never thrives better than when riches are tost from hand to hand” sir dudley north “discourses upon trade” lond pp passim herrenschwand’s fanciful notions amount merely to this that the antagonism which has its origin in the nature of commodities and is reproduced in their circulation can be removed by increasing the circulating medium but if on the one hand it is a popular delusion to ascribe stagnation in production and circulation to insufficiency of the circulating medium it by no means follows on the other hand that an actual paucity of the medium in consequence eg of bungling legislative interference with the regulation of currency may not give rise to such stagnation “there is a certain measure and proportion of money requisite to drive the trade of a nation more or less than which would prejudice the same just as there is a certain proportion of farthings necessary in a small retail trade to change silver money and to even such reckonings as cannot be adjusted with the smallest silver pieces now as the proportion of the number of farthings requisite in commerce is to be taken from the number of people the frequency of their exchanges as also and principally from the value of the smallest silver pieces of money so in like manner the proportion of money gold and silver specie requisite in our trade is to be likewise taken from the frequency of commutations and from the bigness of the payments” william petty “a treatise of taxes and contributions” lond p the theory of hume was defended against the attacks of j steuart and others by a young in his “political arithmetic” lond in which work there is a special chapter entitled “prices depend on quantity of money at p sqq i have stated in “zur kritik c” p “he adam smith passes over without remark the question as to the quantity of coin in circulation and treats money quite wrongly as a mere commodity” this statement applies only in so far as adam smith ex officio treats of money now and then however as in his criticism of the earlier systems of political economy he takes the right view “the quantity of coin in every country is regulated by the value of the commodities which are to be circulated by it the value of the goods annually bought and sold in any country requires a certain quantity of money to circulate and distribute them to their proper consumers and can give employment to no more the channel of circulation necessarily draws to itself a sum sufficient to fill it and never admits any more” “wealth of nations” bk iv ch in like manner ex officio he opens his work with an apotheosis on the division of labour afterwards in the last book which treats of the sources of public revenue he occasionally repeats the denunciations of the division of labour made by his teacher a ferguson “the prices of things will certainly rise in every nation as the gold and silver increase amongst the people and consequently where the gold and silver decrease in any nation the prices of all things must fall proportionately to such decrease of money” jacob vanderlint “money answers all things” lond p a careful comparison of this book with hume’s “essays” proves to my mind without doubt that hume was acquainted with and made use of vanderlint’s work which is certainly an important one the opinion that prices are determined by the quantity of the circulating medium was also held by barbon and other much earlier writers “no inconvenience” says vanderlint “can arise by an unrestrained trade but very great advantage since if the cash of the nation be decreased by it which prohibitions are designed to prevent those nations that get the cash will certainly find everything advance in price as the cash increases amongst them and our manufactures and everything else will soon become so moderate as to turn the balance of trade in our favour and thereby fetch the money back again” lc pp that the price of each single kind of commodity forms a part of the sum of the prices of all the commodities in circulation is a selfevident proposition but how usevalues which are incommensurable with regard to each other are to be exchanged en masse for the total sum of gold and silver in a country is quite incomprehensible if we start from the notion that all commodities together form one single commodity of which each is but an aliquot part we get the following beautiful result the total commodity x cwt of gold commodity a an aliquot part of the total commodity the same aliquot part of x cwt of gold this is stated in all seriousness by montesquieu “si l’on compare la masse de l’or et de l’argent qui est dans le monde avec la somme des marchandises qui s’y vend il est certain que chaque denrée ou marchandise en particulier pourra être comparée à une certaine portion de la masse entière supposons qu’il n’y ait qu’une seule denrée ou marchandise dans le monde ou qu’il n’y ait qu’une seule qui s’achète et qu’elle se divise comme l’argent cette partie de cette marchandise répondra à une partie de la masse de l’argent la moitié du total de l’une à la moitié du total de l’autre c l’établissement du prix des choses dépend toujours fondamentalement de la raison du total des choses au total des signes” “if one compares the amount of gold and silver in the world with the sum of the commodities available it is certain that each product or commodity taken in isolation could be compared with a certain portion of the total amount of money let us suppose that there is only one product or commodity in the world or only one that can be purchased and that it can be divided in the same way as money a certain part of this commodity would then correspond to a part of the total amount of money half the total of the one would correspond to half the total of the other c the determination of the prices of things always depends fundamentally on the relation between the total amount of things and the total amount of their monetary symbols” montesquieu lc t iii pp as to the further development of this theory by ricardo and his disciples james mill lord overstone and others see “zur kritik c” pp and p sqq john stuart mill with his usual eclectic logic understands how to hold at the same time the view of his father james mill and the opposite view on a comparison of the text of his compendium “principles of pol econ” with his preface to the first edition in which preface he announces himself as the adam smith of his day — we do not know whether to admire more the simplicity of the man or that of the public who took him in good faith for the adam smith he announced himself to be although he bears about as much resemblance to adam smith as say general williams of kars to the duke of wellington the original researches of mr j s mill which are neither extensive nor profound in the domain of political economy will be found mustered in rank and file in his little work “some unsettled questions of political economy” which appeared in locke asserts point blank the connexion between the absence of value in gold and silver and the determination of their values by quantity alone “mankind having consented to put an imaginary value upon gold and silver the intrinsic value regarded in these metals is nothing but the quantity “some considerations” c works ed vol ii p it lies of course entirely beyond my purpose to take into consideration such details as the s eigniorage on minting i will however cite for the benefit of the romantic sycophant adam muller who admires the “generous liberality” with which the english government coins gratuitously the following opinion of sir dudley north “silver and gold like other commodities have their ebbings and flowings upon the arrival of quantities from spain it is carried into the tower and coined not long after there will come a demand for bullion to be exported again if there is none but all happens to be in coin what then melt it down again there’s no loss in it for the coining costs the owner nothing thus the nation has been abused and made to pay for the twisting of straw for asses to eat if the merchant were made to pay the price of the coinage he would not have sent his silver to the tower without consideration and coined money would always keep a value above uncoined silver” north lc p north was himself one of the foremost merchants in the reign of charles ii “if silver never exceed what is wanted for the smaller payments it cannot be collected in sufficient quantities for the larger payments the use of gold in the main payments necessarily implies also its use in the retail trade those who have gold coin offering them for small purchases and receiving with the commodity purchased a balance of silver in return by which means the surplus of silver that would otherwise encumber the retail dealer is drawn off and dispersed into general circulation but if there is as much silver as will transact the small payments independent of gold the retail trader must then receive silver for small purchases and it must of necessity accumulate in his hands” david buchanan “inquiry

fresh class of sovereigns becomes too light the class which one year passes with full weight loses enough by wear and tear to draw the scales next year against it” house of lords’ committee n the following passage from fullarton shows the want of clearness on the part of even the best writers on money in their comprehension of its various functions “that as far as concerns our domestic exchanges all the monetary functions which are usually performed by gold and silver coins may be performed as effectually by a circulation of inconvertible notes paying no value but that factitious and conventional value they derive from the law is a fact which admits i conceive of no denial value of this description may be made to answer all the purposes of intrinsic value and supersede even the necessity for a standard provided only the quantity of issues be kept under due limitation” fullerton “regulation of currencies” london p because the commodity that serves as money is capable of being replaced in circulation by mere symbols of value therefore its functions as a measure of value and a standard of prices are declared to be superfluous from the fact that gold and silver so far as they are coins or exclusively serve as the medium of circulation become mere tokens of themselves nicholas barbon deduces the right of governments “to raise money” that is to give to the weight of silver that is called a shilling the name of a greater weight such as a crown and so to pay creditors shillings instead of crowns “money does wear and grow lighter by often telling over it is the denomination and currency of the money that men regard in bargaining and not the quantity of silver’tis the public authority upon the metal that makes it money” n barbon lc pp “une richesse en argent

can be realised before the usevalue of the money is realised and the commodity actually delivered this occurs constantly under the everyday form of prepayments and it is under this form that the english government purchases opium from the ryots of india in these cases however the money always acts as a means of purchase of course capital also is advanced in the shape of money this point of view however does not fall within the horizon of simple circulation” “zur kritik c” pp the monetary crisis referred to in the text being a phase of every crisis must be clearly distinguished from that particular form of crisis which also is called a monetary crisis but which may be produced by itself as an independent phenomenon in such a way as to react only indirectly on industry and commerce the pivot of these crises is to be found in moneyed capital and their sphere of direct action is therefore the sphere of that capital viz banking the stock exchange and finance “the sudden reversion from

expense being millions if the revolutions were in such short circles viz weekly as happens among poor artisans and labourers who receive and pay every saturday then parts of million of money would answer these ends but if the circles be quarterly according to our custom of paying rent and gathering taxes then millions were requisite wherefore supposing payments in general to be of a mixed circle between one week and then add millions to the half of which will be ½ so as if we have ½ millions we have enough” william petty “political anatomy of ireland” edit lond pp hence the absurdity of every law prescribing that the banks of a country shall form reserves of that precious metal alone which circulates at home the “pleasant difficulties” thus selfcreated by the bank of england are well known on the subject of the great epochs in the history of the changes in the relative value of gold and silver see karl marx lc p sq sir robert peel by his bank act of sought to tide over the difficulty by allowing the bank of england to issue notes against silver bullion on condition that the reserve of silver should never exceed more than onefourth of the reserve of gold the value of silver being for that purpose estimated at its price in the london market added in the th german edition — we find ourselves once more in a period of serious change in the relative values of gold and silver about years ago the ratio expressing the relative value of gold and silver was now it is approximately and silver is still constantly falling as against gold this is essentially the result of a revolution in the mode of production of both metals formerly gold was obtained almost exclusively by washing it out from goldbearing alluvial deposits products of the weathering of auriferous rocks now this method has become inadequate and has been forced into the background by the processing of the quartz lodes themselves a way of extraction which formerly was only of secondary importance although well known to the ancients diodorus iii diodor’s v sicilien “historische bibliothek” book iii stuttgart pp moreover not only were new huge silver deposits discovered in north america in the western part of the rocky mountains but these and the mexican silver mines were really opened up by the laying of railways which made possible the shipment of modern machinery and fuel and in consequence the mining of silver on a very large scale at a low cost however there is a great difference in the way the two metals occur in the quartz lodes the gold is mostly native but disseminated throughout the quartz in minute quantities the whole mass of the vein must therefore be crushed and the gold either washed out or extracted by means of mercury often grammes of quartz barely yield and very seldom grammes of gold silver is seldom found native however it occurs in special quartz that is separated from the lode with comparative ease and contains mostly silver or it is contained in smaller quantities in copper lead and other ores which in themselves are worthwhile working from this alone it is apparent that the labour expended on the production of gold is rather increasing while that expended on silver production has decidedly decreased which quite naturally explains the drop in the value of the latter this fall in value would express itself in a still greater fall in price if the price of silver were not pegged even today by artificial means but america’s rich silver deposits have so far barely been tapped and thus the prospects are that the value of this metal will keep on dropping for rather a long time to come a still greater contributing factor here is the relative decrease in the requirement of silver for articles of general use and for luxuries that is its replacement by plated goods aluminium etc one may thus gauge the utopianism of the bimetallist idea that compulsory international quotation will raise silver again to the old value ratio of it is more likely that silver will forfeit its money function more and more in the markets of the world — f e the opponents themselves of the mercantile system a system which considered the settlement of surplus trade balances in gold and silver as the aim of international trade entirely misconceived the functions of money of the world i have shown by the example of ricardo in what way their false conception of the laws that regulate the quantity of the circulating medium is reflected in their equally false conception of the international movement of the precious metals lc pp sq his erroneous dogma “an unfavourable balance of trade never arises but from a redundant currency the exportation of the coin is caused by its cheapness and is not the effect but the cause of an unfavourable balance” already occurs in barbon “the balance of trade if there be one is not the cause of sending away the money out of a nation but that proceeds from the difference of the value of bullion in every country” n barbon lc pp macculloch in “the literature of political economy a classified catalogue lond ” praises barbon for this anticipation but prudently passes over the naive forms in which barbon clothes the absurd supposition on which the “currency principle” is based the absence of real criticism and even of honesty in that catalogue culminates in the sections devoted to the history of the theory of money the reason is that macculloch in this part of the work is flattering lord overstone whom he calls “facile princeps argentanorum” for instance in subsidies money loans for carrying on wars or for enabling banks to resume cash payments c it is the moneyform and no other of value that may be wanted “i would desire indeed no more convincing evidence of the competency of the machinery of the hoards in speciepaying countries to perform every necessary office of international adjustment without any sensible aid from the general circulation than the facility with which france when but just recovering from the shock of a destructive foreign invasion completed within the space of months the payment of her forced contribution of nearly millions to the allied powers and a considerable proportion of the sum in specie without any perceptible contraction or derangement of her domestic currency or even any alarming fluctuation of her exchanges” fullerton lc p added in the th german edition — we have a still more striking example in the facility with which the same france was able in to pay off within months a forced contribution more than ten times as great a considerable part of it likewise in specie — f e “l’argent se partage entre les nations relativement au besoin qu’elles en ont étant toujours attiré par les productions” “money is shared among the nations in accordance with their need for it as it is always attracted by the products” le trosne lc p “the mines which are continually giving gold and silver do give sufficient to supply such a needful balance to every nation” j vanderlint lc p “exchanges rise and fall every week and at some particular times in the year run high against a nation and at other times run as high on the contrary” n barbon lc p these various functions are liable to come into dangerous conflict with one another whenever gold and silver have also to serve as a fund for the conversion of banknotes “what money is more than of absolute necessity for a home trade is dead stock and brings no profit to that country it’s kept in but as it is transported in trade as well as imported” john bellers “essays” p “what if we have too much coin we may melt down the heaviest and turn it into the splendour of plate vessels or utensils of gold or silver or send it out as a commodity where the same is wanted or desired or let it out at interest where interest is high” w petty “quantulumcunque” p “money is but the fat of the body politick whereof too much doth as often hinder its agility as too little makes it sick as fat lubricates the motion of the muscles feeds in want of victuals fills up the uneven cavities and beautifies the body so doth money in the state quicken its action feeds from abroad in time of dearth at home evens accounts and beautifies the whole altho more especially the particular persons that have it in plenty” w petty “political anatomy of ireland” p the contrast between the power based on the personal relations of dominion and servitude that is conferred by landed property and the impersonal power that is given by money is well expressed by the two french proverbs “nulle terre sans seigneur” and “l’argent n’a pas de maître” – “no land without its lord” and “money has no master” “avec de l’argent on achète des marchandises et avec des marchandises on achète de l’argent” “with money one buys

trade consists in the exchange of things of different kinds and the advantage” to the merchant “arises out of this difference to exchange a pound of bread against a pound of bread would be attended with no advantage hence trade is advantageously contrasted with gambling which consists in a mere exchange of money for money” th corbet “an inquiry into the causes and modes of the wealth of individuals or the principles of trade and speculation explained” london p although corbet does not see that mm the exchange of money for money is the characteristic form of circulation not only of merchants’ capital but of all capital yet at least he acknowledges that this form is common to gambling and to one species of trade viz speculation but then comes macculloch and makes out that to buy in order to sell is to speculate and thus the difference between speculation and trade vanishes “every transaction in which an individual buys produce in order to sell it again is in fact a

aristotle opposes oeconomic to chrematistic he starts from the former so far as it is the art of gaining a livelihood it is limited to procuring those articles that are necessary to existence and useful either to a household or the state “true wealth o aleqinos ploutos consists of such values in use for the quantity of possessions of this kind capable of making life pleasant is not unlimited there is however a second mode of acquiring things to which we may by preference and with correctness give the name of chrematistic and in this case there appear to be no limits to riches and possessions trade e kapelike is literally retail trade and aristotle takes this kind because in it values in use predominate does not in its nature belong to chrematistic for here the exchange has reference only to what is necessary to themselves the buyer or seller” therefore as he goes on to show the original form of trade was barter but with the extension of the latter there arose the necessity for money on the discovery of money barter of necessity developed into kapelike into trading in commodities and this again in opposition to its original tendency grew into chrematistic into the art of making money now chrematistic is distinguishable from oeconomic in this way that “in the case of chrematistic circulation is the source of riches poietike crematon dia chrematon diaboles and it appears to revolve about money for money is the beginning and end of this kind of exchange to nomisma stoiceion tes allages estin therefore also riches such as chrematistic strives for are unlimited just as every art that is not a means to an end but an end in itself has no limit to its aims because it seeks constantly to approach nearer and nearer to that end while those arts that pursue means to an end are not boundless since the goal itself imposes a limit upon them so with chrematistic there are no bounds to its aims these aims being absolute wealth oeconomic not

investigation the reader will see that this statement only means that the formation of capital must be possible even though the price and value of a commodity be the same for its formation cannot be attributed to any deviation of the one from the other if prices actually differ from values we must first of all reduce the former to the latter in other words treat the difference as accidental in order that the phenomena may be observed in their purity and our observations not interfered with by disturbing circumstances that have nothing to do with the process in question we know moreover that this reduction is no mere scientific process the continual oscillations in prices their rising and falling compensate each other and reduce themselves to an average price which is their hidden regulator it forms the guiding star of the merchant or the manufacturer in every undertaking that requires time he knows that when a long period of time is taken commodities are sold neither over nor under but at their average price if therefore he thought about the matter at all he would formulate the problem of the formation of capital as follows how can we account for the origin of capital on the supposition that prices are regulated by the average price i e ultimately by the value of the commodities i say “ultimately” because average prices do not directly coincide with the values of commodities as adam smith ricardo and others believe “hic rhodus hic saltus” – latin usually translated “rhodes is here here is where you jump” originates from the traditional latin translation of the punch line from aesop’s fable the boastful athlete which has been the subject of some mistranslations in greek the maxim reads “ιδού η ρόδος ιδού και το πήδημα” the story is that an athlete boasts that when in rhodes he performed a stupendous jump and that there were witnesses who could back up his story a bystander then remarked ‘alright let’s say this is rhodes demonstrate the jump here and now’ the fable shows that people must be known by their deeds not by their own claims for themselves in the context in which hegel used it in the philosophy of right this could be taken to mean that the philosophy of right must have to do with the actuality of modern society not the theories and ideals that societies create for themselves nor as hegel goes on to say to “teach the world what it ought to be” the epigram is given by hegel first in greek then in latin in the form “hic rhodus hic saltus” and he then says “with little change the above saying would read in german “hier ist die rose hier tanze” “here is the rose dance here” this is taken to be an allusion to the ‘rose in the cross’ of the rosicrucians who claimed to possess esoteric knowledge with which they could transform social life implying that the material for understanding and changing society is given in society itself not in some otherworldly theory punning first on the greek rhodos rhodes rhodon rose then on the latin saltus jump noun salta dance imperative mia editors “in the form of money capital is productive of no profit” ricardo “princ of pol econ” p in encyclopaedias of classical antiquities we find such nonsense as this — that in the ancient world capital was fully developed “except that the free labourer and a system of credit was wanting” mommsen also in his “history of rome” commits in this respect one blunder after another hence legislation in various countries fixes a maximum for labourcontracts wherever free labour is the rule the laws regulate the mode of terminating this contract in some states particularly in mexico before the american civil war also in the territories taken from mexico and also as a matter of fact in the danubian provinces till the revolution effected by kusa slavery is hidden under the form of peonage by means of advances repayable in labour which are handed down from generation to generation not only the individual labourer but his family become de facto the property of other persons and their families juarez abolished peonage the socalled emperor maximilian reestablished it by a decree which in the house of representatives at washington was aptly denounced as a decree for the reintroduction of slavery into mexico “i may make over to another the use for a limited time of my particular bodily and mental aptitudes and capabilities because in consequence of this restriction they are impressed with a character of alienation with regard to me as a whole but by the alienation of all my labourtime and the whole of my work i should be converting the substance itself in other words my general activity and reality my person into the property of another” hegel “philosophie des rechts” berlin p § the capitalist epoch is therefore characterised by this that labourpower takes in the eyes of the labourer himself the form of a commodity which is his property his labour consequently becomes wagelabour on the other hand it is only

even monthly with such long intervals between the payments the agricultural labourer is obliged to buy on credit he must pay higher prices and is in fact tied to the shop which gives him credit thus

in his “réflexions sur la formation et la distribution des richesses” brings well into prominence the importance of domesticated animals to early civilisation the least important commodities of all for the technological comparison of different epochs of production are articles of luxury in the strict meaning of the term however little our written histories up to this time notice the development of material production which is the basis of all social life and therefore of all real history yet prehistoric times have been classified in accordance with the results not of socalled historical but of materialistic investigations these periods have been divided to correspond with the materials from which their implements and weapons were made viz into the stone the bronze and the iron ages it appears paradoxical to assert that uncaught fish for instance are a means of production in the fishing industry but hitherto no one has discovered the art of catching fish in waters that contain none this method of determining from the standpoint of the labourprocess alone what is productive labour is by no means directly applicable to the case of the capitalist process of production storch calls true raw materials “matières” and accessory material “matériaux” cherbuliez describes accessories as “matières instrumentales” by a wonderful feat of logical acumen colonel torrens has discovered in this stone of the savage the origin of capital “in the first stone which he the savage flings at the wild animal he pursues in the first stick that he seizes to strike down the fruit which hangs above his reach we see the appropriation of one article for the purpose of aiding in the acquisition of another and thus discover the origin of capital” r torrens “an essay on the production of wealth” c pp “products are appropriated before they are converted into capital this conversion does not secure them from such appropriation” cheibuliez “richesse ou pauvreté” edit paris p “the proletarian by selling his labour for a definite quantity of the necessaries of life renounces all claim to a share in the product the mode of appropriation of the products remains the same as before it is in no way

appropriation a law whose fundamental principle was the very opposite namely that every labourer has an exclusive right to the ownership of what he produces” lc p “when the labourers receive wages for their labour the capitalist is then the owner not of the capital only” he means the means of production “but of the labour also if what is paid as wages is included as it commonly is in the term capital it is absurd to talk of labour separately from capital the word capital as thus employed includes labour and capital both” james mill “elements of pol econ” c ed pp as has been stated in a previous note the english language has two different expressions for these two different aspects of labour in the simple labourprocess the process of producing usevalues it is work in the process of creation of value it is labour taking the term in its strictly economic sense — f e these figures are quite arbitrary this is the fundamental proposition on which is based the doctrine of the physiocrats as to the unproductiveness of all labour that is not agriculture it is irrefutable for the orthodox economist “cette façon d’imputer à une seule chose la valeur de plusieurs autres” par exemple au lin la consommation du tisserand “d’appliquer pour ainsi dire couche sur couche plusieurs valeurs sur une seule fait que celleci grossit d’autant le terme d’addition peint trés bien la maniere dont se forme le prix des ouvrages de main d’oeuvre ce prix n’est qu’un total de plusieurs valeurs consommées et additionnées ensemble or additionner n’est pas multiplier” “this method of adding to one particular object the value of a number of others” for example adding the living costs of the weaver to the flax “of as it were heaping up various values in layers on top of one single value has the result that this value grows to the same extent the expression ‘addition’ gives a very clear picture of the way in which the price of a manufactured product is formed this price is only the sum of a number of values which have been consumed and it is arrived at by adding them together however addition is not the same as multiplication” “mercier de la rivière” lc p thus from he withdrew part of his capital from productive employment in order to throw it away in railway speculations and so also during the american civil war he closed his factory and turned his workpeople into the streets in order to gamble on the liverpool cotton exchange “extol thyself put on finery and adorn thyself but whoever takes more or better than he gives that is usury and is not service but wrong done to his neighbour as when one steals and robs all is not service and benefit to a neighbour that is called service and benefit for an adulteress and adulterer do one another great service and pleasure a horseman does an incendiary a great service by helping him to rob on the highway and pillage land and houses the papists do ours a great service in that they don’t drown burn murder all of them or let them all rot in prison but let some live and only drive them out or take from them what they have the devil himself does his servants inestimable service to sum up the world is full of great excellent and daily service and benefit” martin luther “an die pfarrherrn wider den wucher zu predigen” wittenberg in “zur kritik der pol oek” p i make the following remark on this point — “it is not difficult to understand what ‘service’ the category ‘service’ must render to a class of economists like j b say and f bastiat” this is one of the circumstances that makes production by slave labour such a costly process the labourer here is to use a striking expression of the ancients distinguishable only as instrumentum vocale from an animal as instrumentum semivocale and from an implement as instrumentum mutum but he himself takes care to let both beast and implement feel that he is none of them but is a man he convinces himself with immense satisfaction that he is a different being by treating the one unmercifully and damaging the other con amore hence the principle universally applied in this method of production only to employ the rudest and heaviest implements and such as are difficult to damage owing to their sheer clumsiness in the slavestates bordering on the gulf of mexico down to the date of the civil war ploughs constructed on old chinese models which turned up the soil like a hog or a mole instead of making furrows were alone to be found conf j e cairnes “the slave power” london p sqq in his “sea board slave states” olmsted tells us “i am here shown tools that no man in his senses with us would allow a labourcr for whom he was paying wages to be encumbered with and the excessive weight and clumsiness of which i would judge would make work at least ten per cent greater than with those ordinarily used with us and i am assured that in the careless and clumsy way they must be used by the slaves anything lighter or less rude could not be furnished them with good economy and that such tools as we constantly give our labourers and find our profit in giving them would not last out a day in a virginia cornfield – much lighter and more free from stones though it be than ours so too when i ask why mules are so universally substituted for horses on the farm the first reason given and confessedly the most conclusive one is that horses cannot bear the treatment that they always must get from negroes horses are always soon foundered or crippled by them while mules will bear cudgelling or lose a meal or two now and then and not be materially injured and they do not take cold or get sick if neglected or overworked but i do not need to go further than to the window of the room in which i am writing to see at almost any time treatment of cattle that would ensure the immediate discharge of the driver by almost any farmer owning them in the north” the distinction between skilled and unskilled labour rests in part on pure illusion or to say the least on distinctions that have long since ceased to be real and that survive only by virtue of a traditional convention in part on the helpless condition of some groups of the workingclass a condition that prevents them from exacting equally with the rest the value of their labourpower accidental circumstances here play so great a part that these two forms of labour sometimes change places where for instance the physique of the workingclass has deteriorated and is relatively speaking exhausted which is the case in all countries with a well developed capitalist production the lower forms of labour which demand great expenditure of muscle are in general considered as skilled compared with much more delicate forms of labour the latter sink down to the level of unskilled labour take as an example the labour of a bricklayer which in england occupies a much higher level than that of a damaskweaver again although the labour of a fustian cutter demands great bodily exertion and is at the same time unhealthy yet it counts only as unskilled labour and then we must not forget that the socalled skilled labour does not occupy a large space in the field of national labour laing estimates that in england and wales the livelihood of people depends on unskilled labour if from the total population of living at the time when he wrote we deduct for the “genteel population” and for paupers vagrants criminals prostitutes c and who compose the middleclass there remain the above mentioned but in his middleclass he includes people that live on the interest of small investments officials men of letters artists schoolmasters and the like and in order to swell the number he also includes in these the better paid portion of the factory operatives the bricklayers too figure amongst them s laing “national distress” c london “the great class who have nothing to give for food but ordinary labour are the great bulk of the people” james mill in art “colony” supplement to the encyclop brit “where reference is made to labour as a measure of value it necessarily implies labour of one particular kind the proportion which the other kinds bear to it being easily ascertained” “outlines of pol econ” lond pp and “labour gives a new creation for one extinguished” “an essay on the polit econ of nations” london p the subject of repairs of the implements of labour does not concern us here a machine that is undergoing repair no longer plays the part of an instrument but that of a subject of labour work is no longer done with it but upon it it is quite permissible for our purpose to assume that the labour expended on the repairs of instruments is included in the labour necessary for their original production but in the text we deal with that wear and tear which no doctor can cure and which little by little brings about death with “that kind of wear which cannot be repaired from time to time and which in the case of a knife would ultimately reduce it to a state in which the cutler would say of it it is not worth a new blade” we have shewn in the text that a machine takes part in every labourprocess as an integral machine but that into the simultaneous process of creating value it enters only bit by bit how great then is the confusion of ideas exhibited in the following extract “mr ricardo says a portion of the labour of the engineer in making stocking machines” is contained for example in the value of a pair of stockings “yet the total labour that produced each single pair of stockings includes the whole labour of the engineer not a portion for one machine makes many pairs and none of those pairs could have been done without any part of the machine” “obs on certain verbal disputes in pol econ particularly relating to value” p the author an uncommonly selfsatisfied wiseacre is right in his confusion and therefore in his contention to this extent only that neither ricardo nor any other economist before or since him has accurately distinguished the two aspects of labour and still less therefore the part played by it under each of these aspects in the formation of value from this we may judge of the absurdity of j b say who pretends to account for surplusvalue interest profit rent by the “services productifs” which the means of production soil instruments and raw material render in the labourprocess by means of their usevalues mr wm roscher who seldom loses an occasion of registering in black and white ingenious apologetic fancies records the following specimen “j b say traité t ch very truly remarks the value produced by an oil mill after deduction of all costs is something new something quite different from the labour by which the oil mill itself was erected” lc p note very true mr professor the oil produced by the oil mill is indeed something very different from the labour expended in constructing the mill by value mr roscher understands such stuff as “oil” because oil has value notwithstanding that “nature” produces petroleum though relatively “in small quantities” a fact to which he seems to refer in his further observation “it nature produces scarcely any exchangevalue” mr roscher’s “nature” and the exchangevalue it produces are rather like the foolish virgin who admitted indeed that she had had a child but “it was such a little one” this “savant sérieux” in continuation remarks “ricardo’s school is in the habit of including capital as accumulated labour under the head of labour this is unskilful work because indeed the owner of capital after all does something more than the merely creating and preserving of the same namely the abstention from the enjoyment of it for which he demands eg interest” lc how very “skilful” is this “anatomicophysiological method” of political economy which “indeed” converts a mere desire “after all” into a source of value “of all the instruments of the farmers’ trade the labour of man is that on which he is most to rely for the repayment of his capital the other two the working stock of the cattle and the carts ploughs spades and so forth without a given portion of the first are nothing at

for the existence and comfort of the human being are also changed they are consumed from time to time and their value reappears in that new vigour imparted to his body and mind forming fresh capital to be employed again in the work of production” f wayland lc pp without noticing any other oddities it suffices to observe that what reappears in the fresh vigour is not the bread’s price but its bloodforming substances what on the other hand reappears in the value of that vigour is not the means of subsistence but their value the same necessaries of life at half the price would form just as much muscle and bone just as much vigour but not vigour of the same value this confusion of “value” and “vigour” coupled with our author’s pharisaical indefiniteness mark an attempt futile for all that to thrash out an explanation of surplusvalue from a mere reappearance of preexisting values “toutes les productions d’un même genre ne forment proprement qu’une masse dont le prix se détermine en général et sans égard aux circonstances particulières” le trosne lc p “properly speaking all products of the same kind form a single mass and their price is determined in general and without regard to particular circumstances” “if we reckon the value of the fixed capital employed as a part of the advances we must reckon the remaining value of such capital at the end of the year as a part of the annual returns” malthus “princ of pol econ” nd ed lond p what lucretius says is selfevident “nil posse creari de nihilo” out of nothing nothing can be created creation of value is transformation of labourpower into labour labourpower itself is energy transferred to a human organism by means of nourishing matter in the same way that the english use the terms “rate of profit” “rate of interest” we shall see in book iii that the rate of profit is no mystery so soon as we know the laws of surplusvalue if we reverse the process we cannot comprehend either the one or the other note added in the rd german edition — the author resorts here to the economic language in current use it will be remembered that on p present edition p it was shown that in reality the labourer “advances” to the capitalist and not the capitalist to the labourer — f e in this work we have up to now employed the term “necessary labourtime” to designate the time necessary under given social conditions for the production of any commodity henceforward we use it to designate also the time necessary for the production of the particular commodity labourpower the use of one and the same technical term in different senses is inconvenient but in no science can it be altogether avoided compare for instance the higher with the lower branches of mathematics herr wilhelm thucydides roscher has found a mare’s nest he has made the important discovery that if on the one hand the formation of surplusvalue or surplusproduce and the consequent accumulation of capital is nowadays due to the thrift of the capitalist on the other hand in the lowest stages of civilisation it is the strong who compel the weak to economise lc p to economise what labour or superfluous wealth that does not exist what is it that makes such men as roscher account for the origin of surplusvalue by a mere rechauffé of the more of less plausible excuses by the capitalist for his appropriation of surplusvalue it is besides their real ignorance their apologetic dread of a scientific analysis of value and surplusvalue and of obtaining a result possibly not altogether palatable to the powers that be although the rate of surplusvalue is an exact expression for the degree of exploitation of labourpower it is in no sense an expression for the absolute amount of exploitation for example if the necessary labour hours and the surplus labour hours the degree of exploitation is the amount of exploitation is here measured by hours if on the other hand the necessary labour hours and the surplus labour hours the degree of exploitation remains as before while the actual amount of exploitation has increased namely from five hours to six the above data which may be relied upon were given me by a manchester spinner in england the horsepower of an engine was formerly calculated from the diameter of its cylinder now the actual horsepower shown by the indicator is taken the calculations given in the text are intended merely as illustrations we have in fact assumed that prices values we shall however see in book iii that even in the case of average prices the assumption cannot be made in this very simple manner senior lc pp we let pass such extraordinary notions as are of no importance for our purpose for instance the assertion that manufacturers reckon as part of their profit gross or net the amount required to make good wear and tear of machinery or in other words to replace a part of the capital so too we pass over any question as to the accuracy of his figures leonard horner has shown in “a letter to mr senior” c london that they are worth no more than socalled “analysis” leonard horner was one of the factory inquiry commissioners in and inspector or rather censor of factories till he rendered undying service to the english workingclass he carried on a lifelong contest not only with the embittered manufacturers but also with the cabinet to whom the number of votes given by the masters in the lower house was a matter of far greater importance than the number of hours worked by the “hands” in the mills apart from efforts in principle senior’s statement is confused what he really intended to say was this the manufacturer employs the workman for ½ hours or for halfhours daily as the working day so too the working year may be conceived to consist of ½ hours or halfhours but each multiplied by the number of working days in the year on this supposition the halfhours yield an annual product of £ one halfhour yields × £ halfhours yield × £ £ ie they replace no more than the capital advanced there remain halfhours which yield × £ £ or the gross profit of these halfhours one yields × £ £ ie it makes up for the wear and tear of the machinery the remaining halfhours ie the last hour yield × £ £ or the net profit in the text senior converts the last of the product into portions of the working day itself if on the one hand senior proved that the net profit of the manufacturer the existence of he english cotton industry and england’s command of the markets of the world depend on “the last workinghour” on the other hand dr andrew ure showed that if children and young persons under years of age instead of being kept the full hours in the warm and pure moral atmosphere of the factory are turned out an hour sooner into the heartless and frivolous outer world they will be deprived by idleness and vice of all hope of salvation for their souls since the factory inspectors have never tired of twitting the masters with this “last” this “fatal hour” thus mr hovell in his report of the st may “had the following ingenious calculation he quotes senior been correct every cotton factory in the united kingdom would have been working at a loss since the year ” reports of the insp of fact for the halfyear ending th april pp in the year after the passing of the hours’ bill the masters of some flax spinning mills scattered few and far between over the country on the borders of dorset and somerset foisted a petition against the bill on to the shoulders of a few of their workpeople one of the clauses of this petition is as follows “your petitioners as parents conceive that an additional hour of leisure will tend more to demoralise the children than otherwise believing that idleness is the parent of vice” on this the factory report of st oct says the atmosphere of the flax mills in which the children of these virtuous and tender parents work is so loaded with dust and fibre from the raw material that it is exceptionally unpleasant to stand even minutes in the spinning rooms for you are unable to do so without the most painful sensation owing to the eyes the ears the nostrils and mouth being immediately filled by the clouds of flax dust from which there is no escape the labour itself owing to the feverish haste of the machinery demands unceasing application of skill and movement under the control of a watchfulness that never tires and it seems somewhat hard to let parents apply the term “idling” to their own children who after allowing for mealtimes are fettered for whole hours to such an occupation in such an atmosphere these children work longer than the labourers in the neighbouring villages such cruel talk about “idleness and vice” ought to be branded as the purest cant and the most shameless hypocrisy that portion of the public who about years ago were struck by the assurance with which under the sanction of high authority it was publicly and most earnestly proclaimed that the whole net profit of the manufacturer flows from the labour of the last hour and that therefore the reduction of the working day by one hour would destroy his net profit that portion of the public we say will hardly believe its own eyes when it now finds that the original discovery of the virtues of “the last hour” has since been so far improved as to include morals as well as profit so that if the duration of the labour of children is reduced to a full hours their morals together with the net profits of their employers will vanish both being dependent on this last this fatal hour see repts insp of fact for st oct p the same report then gives some examples of the morality and virtue of these same pureminded manufacturers of the tricks the artifices the cajoling the threats and the falsifications they made use of in order first to compel a few defenceless workmen to sign petitions of such a kind and then to impose them upon parliament as the petitions of a whole branch of industry or a whole country it is highly characteristic of the present status of socalled economic science that neither senior himself who at a later period to his honour be it said energetically supported the factory legislation nor his opponents from first to last have ever been able to explain the false conclusions of the “original discovery” they appeal to actual experience but the why and wherefore remains a mystery nevertheless the learned professor was not without some benefit from his journey to manchester in the “letters on the factory act” he makes the whole net gains including “profit” and “interests” and even “something more” depend upon a single unpaid hour’s work of the labourer one year previously in his “outlines of political economy” written for the instruction of oxford students and cultivated philistines he had also “discovered in opposition to ricardo’s determination of value by labour that profit is derived from the labour of the capitalist and interest from his asceticism in other words from his abstinence” the dodge was an old one but the word “abstinence” was new herr roscher translates it rightly by “enthaltung” some of his countrymen the browns jones and robinsons of germany not so well versed in latin as he have monklike rendered it by “entsagung” renunciation “to an individual with a capital of £ whose profits were £ per annum it would be a matter quite indifferent whether his capital would employ a or men whether the commodity produced sold for £ or £ provided in all cases his profit were not diminished below £ is not the real interest of the nation similar provided its net real income its rent and profits be the same it is of no importance whether the nation consists of or of millions of inhabitants” ric lcp long before ricardo arthur young a fanatical upholder

lancashire and cheshire” under this system the manufacturer entered into a contract with the workhouse authorities for a certain period he fed clothed and lodged the children and gave them a small allowance of money a remark of mr redgrave to be quoted directly seems strange especially if we consider that even among the years of prosperity of the english cotton trade the year stands unparalleled and that besides wages were exceptionally high for this extraordinary demand for work had to contend with the depopulation of ireland with unexampled emigration from the english and scotch agricultural districts to australia and america with an actual diminution of the population in some of the english agricultural districts in consequence partly of an actual breakdown of the vital force of the labourers partly of the already effected dispersion of the disposable population through the dealers in human flesh despite all this mr redgrave says “this kind of labour however would only be sought after when none other could be procured for it is a highpriced labour the ordinary wages of a boy of would be about s per week but to lodge to clothe to feed and to provide medical attendance and proper superintendence for or of these boys and to set aside some remuneration for them could not be accomplished for s ahead per week” report of the inspector of factories for

labourtime c must be regarded as the model industry of england the english cotton operative is in every respect better off than his continental companion in misery “the prussian factory operative

business and thus to make great profits at the expense of the small employers the latter thereupon turned in their extremity to the operatives urged them earnestly to agitate for the hours’ system and promised contributions in money to this end the labour statutes the like of which were enacted at the same time in france the netherlands and elsewhere were first formally repealed in england in long

irregularity of uterine functions hysteria in its most aggravated forms and rheumatism all of these i believe are either directly or indirectly induced by the impure overheated air of the apartments

on the supplementary law of torn from these openair bleachers “the act has not only failed to afford that protection to the workers which it appears to offer but contains a clause apparently so worded that unless persons are detected working after o’clock at night they appear to come under no protective provisions at all and if they do so work the mode of proof is so doubtful that a conviction can

steuart is the economist who has handled this subject best how little his book which appeared ten years before the “wealth of nations” is known even at the present time may be judged from the fact that the admirers of malthus do not even know that the first edition of the latter’s work on population contains except in the purely declamatory part very little but extracts from steuart and in a less degree from wallace and townsend “there is a certain density of population which is convenient both for social intercourse and for that combination of powers by which the produce of labour is

the great wants of the great body of the people every different branch of the work employs so great a number of workmen that it is impossible to collect them all into the same workhouse the division is not near so obvious” a smith “wealth of nations” bk i ch i the celebrated passage in the same chapter that begins with the words “observe the accommodation of the most common artificer or daylabourer in a civilised and thriving country” c and then proceeds to depict what an enormous number and variety of industries contribute to the satisfaction of the wants of an ordinary labourer is copied almost word for word from b de mandeville’s remarks to his “fable of the bees or private vices publick benefits” first ed without the remarks with the remarks “there is no longer anything which we can call the natural reward of individual labour each labourer produces only some part of a whole and each part having no value or utility in itself there is nothing on which the labourer can seize

products” question what is an industrial product answer of the legislature a thing is produced “when it is made” and it is made when it is ready for sale now for one example out of many the new york and philadelphia manufacturers had previously been in the habit of “making” umbrellas with all their belongings but since an umbrella is a mixtum compositum of very heterogeneous parts by degrees these parts became the products of various separate industries carried on independently in different places they entered as separate commodities into the umbrella manufactory where they were fitted together the yankees have given to articles thus fitted together the name of “assembled articles” a name they deserve for being an assemblage of taxes thus the umbrella “assembles” first on the price of each of its elements and a further on its own total price “on peut établir en règle générale que moins l’autorité préside à la division du travail dans l’intérieur de la société plus la division du travail se développe dans l’intérieur de l’atelier et plus elle y est soumise à l’autorité d’un seul ainsi l’autorité dans l’atelier et celle dans la société par rapport à la division du travail sont en raison inverse l’une de l’autre” it can be laid down as a general rule that the less authority presides over the division of labour inside society the more the division of labour develops inside the workshop and the more it is subjected there to the authority of a single person thus authority in the workshop and authority in society in relation to the division of labour are in inverse ratio

herr roscher who to recompense the capitalist from whose jovian head division of labour sprang ready formed dedicates to him “various wages” diverse arbeitslöhne the more or less extensive application of division of labour depends on length of purse not on greatness of genius the older writers like petty and the anonymous author of “advantages of the east india trade” bring out the capitalist character of division of labour as applied in manufacture more than a smith does amongst the moderns may be excepted a few writers of the th century like beccaria and james harris who with regard to division of labour almost entirely follow the ancients thus beccaria “ciascuno prova coll’esperienza che applicando la mano e l’ingegno sempre allo stesso genere di opere e di produtte egli più facili più abbondanti e migliori ne traca risultati di quello che se ciascuno isolatamente le cose tutte a se necessarie soltanto facesse dividendosi in tal maniera per la comune e privata utilità gli uomini in varie classi e condizioni” everyone knows from experience that if the hands and the intelligence are always applied to the same kind of work and the same products these will be produced more easily

without landed property with plato division of labour within the community is a development from the multifarious requirements and the limited capacities of individuals the main point with him is that the labourer must adapt himself to the work not the work to the labourer which latter is unavoidable if he carries on several trades at once thus making one or the other of them subordinate “ou gar

one thing for which he is naturally fitted rep ed baiter orelli c so in thucydides lc c “seafaring is an art like any other and cannot as circumstances require be carried on as a subsidiary occupation

their first appearance a critical history of technology would show how little any of the inventions of the th century are the work of a single individual hitherto there is no such book darwin has interested us in the history of nature’s technology ie in the formation of the organs of plants and animals which organs serve as instruments of production for sustaining life does not the history of the productive organs of man of organs that are the material basis of all social organisation deserve equal attention and would not such a history be easier to compile since as vico says human history differs from natural history in this that we have made the former but not the latter technology discloses man’s mode of dealing with nature the process of production by which he sustains his life and thereby also lays bare the mode of formation of his social relations and of the mental conceptions that flow from them every history of religion even that fails to take account of this material basis is uncritical it is in reality much easier to discover by analysis the earthly core of the misty creations of religion than conversely it is to develop from the actual relations of life the corresponding celestialised forms of those relations the latter method is the only materialistic and therefore the only scientific one the weak points in the abstract materialism of natural science a materialism that excludes history and its process are at once evident from the abstract and ideological conceptions of its spokesmen whenever they venture beyond the bounds of their own speciality especially in the original form of the powerloom we recognise at the first glance the ancient loom in its modern form the powerloom has undergone essential alterations it is only during the last years ie since about that a constantly increasing portion of these machine tools have been made in england by machinery and that not by the same manufacturers who make the machines instances of machines for the fabrication of these mechanical tools are the automatic bobbinmaking engine the cardsetting engine shuttlemaking machines and machines for forging mule and throstle spindles moses says “thou shalt not muzzle the ox that treads the corn” the christian philanthropists of germany on the contrary fastened a wooden board round the necks of the serfs whom they used as a motive power for grinding in order to prevent them from putting flour into their mouths with their hands it was partly the want of streams with a good fall on them and partly their battles with superabundance of water in other respects that compelled the dutch to resort to wind as a motive power the windmill itself they got from germany where its invention was the origin of a pretty squabble between the nobles the priests and the emperor as to which of those three the wind “belonged” the air makes bondage was the cry in germany at the same time that the wind was making holland free what it reduced to bondage in this case was not the dutchman but the land for the dutchman in windmills of horsepower were still employed in holland to prevent twothirds of the land from being reconverted into morasses it was indeed very much improved by watt’s first socalled single acting engine but in this form it continued to be a mere machine for raising water and the liquor from salt mines “the union of all these simple instruments set in motion by a single motor constitutes a machine” babbage lc in january john c morton read before the society of arts a paper on “the forces employed in agriculture” he there states “every improvement that furthers the uniformity of the land makes the steamengine more and more applicable to the production of pure mechanical force horsepower is requisite wherever crooked fences and other obstructions prevent uniform action these obstructions are vanishing day by day for operations that demand more exercise of will than actual force the only power applicable is that controlled every instant by the human mindin other words manpower” mr morton then reduces steampower horsepower and manpower to the unit in general use for steamengines namely the force required to raise lbs one foot in one minute and reckons the cost of one horsepower from a steamengine to be d and from a horse to be ½d per hour further if a horse must fully maintain its health it can work no more than hours a day three at the least out of every seven horses used on tillage land during the year can be dispensed with by using steampower at an expense not greater than that which the horses dispensed with would cost during the or months in which alone they can be used effectively lastly steampower in those agricultural operations in which it can be employed improves in comparison with horsepower the quality of the work to do the work of a steamengine would require men at a total cost of s an hour and to do the work of a horse men at a total cost of s an hour faulhaber de caus the modern turbine frees the industrial exploitation of waterpower from many of its former fetters “in the early days of textile manufactures the locality of the factory depended upon the existence of a stream having a sufficient fall to turn a waterwheel and although the establishment of the watermills was the commencement of the breaking up of the domestic system of manufacture yet the mills necessarily situated upon streams and frequently at considerable distances the one from the other formed part of a rural rather than an urban system and it was not until the introduction of the steampower as a substitute for the stream that factories were congregated in towns and localities where the coal and water required for the production of steam were found in sufficient quantities the steamengine is the parent of manufacturing towns” a redgrave in “reports of the insp of fact th april ” p from the standpoint of division of labour in manufacture weaving was not simple but on the contrary complicated manual labour and consequently the powerloom is a machine that does very complicated work it is altogether erroneous to suppose that modern machinery originally appropriated those operations alone which division of labour had simplified spinning and weaving were during the manufacturing period split up into new species and the implements were modified and improved but the labour itself was in no way divided and it retained its handicraft character it is not the labour but the instrument of labour that serves as the startingpoint of the machine before the epoch of mechanical industry the wool manufacture was the predominating manufacture in england hence it was in this industry that in the first half of the th century the most experiments were made cotton which required less careful preparation for its treatment by machinery derived the benefit of the experience gained on wool just as afterwards the manipulation of wool by machinery was developed on the lines of cottonspinning and weaving by machinery it was only during the years immediately preceding that isolated details of the wool manufacture such as woolcombing were incorporated in the factory system “the application of power to the process of combing wool extensively in operation since the introduction of the combingmachine especially lister’s undoubtedly had the effect of throwing a very large number of men out of work wool was formerly combed by hand most frequently in the cottage of the comber it is now very generally combed in the factory and handlabour is superseded except in some particular kinds of work in which handcombed wool is still preferred many of the handcombers found employment in the factories but the produce of the handcombers bears so small a proportion to that of the machine that the employment of a very large number of combers has passed away” “rep of lnsp of fact for st oct ” p “the principle of the factory system then is to substitute the partition of a process into its essential constituents for the division or graduation of labour among artisans” andrew ure “the philosophy of manufactures” lond p the powerloom was at first made chiefly of wood in its improved modern form it is made of iron to what an extent the old forms of the instruments of production influenced their new forms at first starting is shown by amongst other things the most superficial comparison of the present powerloom with the old one of the modern blowing apparatus of a blastfurnace with the first inefficient mechanical reproduction of the ordinary bellows and perhaps more strikingly than in any other way by the attempts before the invention of the present locomotive to construct a locomotive that actually had two feet which after the fashion of a horse it raised alternately from the ground it is only after considerable development of the science of mechanics and accumulated practical experience that the form of a machine becomes settled entirely in accordance with mechanical principles and emancipated from the traditional form of the tool that gave rise to it eli whitney’s cotton gin had until very recent times undergone less essential changes than any other machine of the th century it is only during the last decade ie since that another american mr emery of albany new york has rendered whitney’s gin antiquated by an improvement as simple as it is effective “the industry of nations” lond part ii p this work also remarks ‘simple and outwardly unimportant as this appendage to lathes may appear it is not we believe averring too much to state that its influence in improving and extending the use of machinery has been as great as that produced by watt’s improvements of the steamengine itself its introduction went at once to perfect all machinery to cheapen it and to stimulate invention and improvement” one of these machines used for forging paddlewheel shafts in london is called “thor” it forges a shaft of ½ tons with as much ease as a blacksmith forges a horseshoe woodworking machines that are also capable of being employed on a small scale are mostly american inventions science generally speaking costs the capitalist nothing a fact that by no means hinders him from exploiting it the science of others is as much annexed by capital as the labour of others capitalistic appropriation and personal appropriation whether of science or of material wealth are however totally different things dr ure himself deplores the gross ignorance of mechanical science existing among his dear machineryexploiting manufacturers and liebig can a tale unfold about the astounding ignorance of chemistry displayed by english chemical manufacturers ricardo lays such stress on this effect of machinery of which in other connexions he takes no more notice than he does of the general distinction between the labour process and the process of creating surplusvalue that he occasionally loses sight of the value given up by machines to the product and puts machines on the same footing as natural forces thus “adam smith nowhere undervalues the services which the natural agents and machinery perform for us but he very justly distinguishes the nature of the value which they add to commodities as they perform their work gratuitously the assistance which they afford us adds nothing to value in exchange” ric lc pp this observation of ricardo is of course correct in so far as it is directed against j b say who imagines that machines render the “service” of creating value which forms a part of “profits” a horsepower is equal to a force of footpounds per minute ie to a force that raises pounds one foot in a minute or one pound feet this is the horse power meant in the text in ordinary language and also here and there in quotations in this work a distinction is drawn between the “nominal” and the “commercial” or “indicated” horsepower of the same engine the old or nominal horsepower is calculated exclusively from the length of pistonstroke and the diameter of the cylinder and leaves pressure of steam and piston speed out of consideration it expresses practically this this engine would be one of horsepower if it were driven with the same low pressure of steam and the same slow piston speed as in the days of boulton and watt but the two latter factors have increased enormously since those days in order to measure the mechanical force exerted today by an engine an indicator has been invented which shows the pressure of the steam in the cylinder the piston speed is easily ascertained thus the “indicated” or “commercial” horsepower of an engine is expressed by a mathematical formula involving diameter of cylinder length of stroke piston speed and steam pressure simultaneously and showing what multiple of pounds is really raised by the engine in a minute hence one “nominal” horsepower may exert three four or even five “indicated” or “real” horsepowers this observation is made for the purpose of explaining various citations in the subsequent pages — f e the reader who is imbued with capitalist notions will naturally miss here the “interest” that the machine in proportion to its capital value adds to the product it is however easily seen that since a machine no more creates new value than any other part of constant capital it cannot add any value under the name of “interest” it is also evident that here where we are treating of the production of surplusvalue we cannot assume a priori the existence of any part of that value under the name of interest the capitalist mode of calculating which appears primâ facie absurd and repugnant to the laws of the creation of value will be explained in the third book of this work this portion of value which is added by the machinery decreases both absolutely and relatively when the machinery does away with horses and other animals that are employed as mere moving forces and not as machines for changing the form of matter it may here be incidentally observed that descartes in defining animals as mere machines saw with eyes of the manufacturing period while to eyes of the middle ages animals were assistants to man as they were later to von haller in his “restauration der staatswissenschaften” that descartes like bacon anticipated an alteration in the form of production and the practical subjugation of nature by man as a result of the altered methods of thought is plain from his “discours de la méthode” he there says “il est possible by the methods he introduced in philosophy de parvenir à des connaissances fort utiles à la vie et qu’au lieu de cette philosophie spéculative qu’on enseigne dans les écoles on en peut trouver une pratique par laquelle connaissant la force et les actions du feu de l’eau de l’air des astres et de tous les autres corps qui nous environnent aussi distinctement que nous connaissons les divers métiers de nos artisans nous les pourrions employer en même façon à tous les usages auxquels ils sont propres et ainsi nous rendre comme maîtres et possesseurs de la nature” and thus “contribuer au perfectionnement de la vie humaine” it is possible to attain knowledge very useful in life and in place of the speculative philosophy taught in the schools one can find a practical philosophy by which given that we know the powers and the effectiveness of fire water air the stars and all the other bodies that surround us as well and as accurately as we know the various trades of our craftsmen we shall be able to employ them in the same manner as the latter to all uses to which they are adapted and thus as it were make ourselves the masters and possessors of nature and thus contributing to the perfection of human life in the preface to sir dudley north’s “discourses upon trade” it is stated that descartes’ method had begun to free political economy from the old fables and superstitious notions of gold trade c on the whole however the early english economists sided with bacon and hobbes as their philosophers while at a later period the philosopher of political economy in england france and italy was locke according to the annual report of the essen chamber of commerce there was produced in at the caststeel works of krupp with its furnaces thirtytwo steamengines in the year this was about the number of all the steamengines working in manchester and fourteen steamhammers representing in all horsepower fortynine forges toolmachines and about workmen thirteen million pounds of cast steel here there are not two workmen to each horsepower babbage estimates that in java the spinning labour alone adds to the value of the cotton at the same period the total value added to the cotton by machinery and labour in the finespinning industry amounted to about of the value of the cotton “on the economy of machinery” pp machine printing also economises colour see paper read by dr watson reporter on products to the government of india before the society of arts th april “these mute agents machines are always the produce of much less labour than that which they displace even when they are of the same moneyvalue” ricardo lc p hence in a communistic society there would be a very different scope for the employment of machinery than there can be in a bourgeois society “employers of labour would not unnecessarily retain two sets of children under thirteen in fact one class of manufacturers the spinners of woollen yarn now rarely employ children under thirteen years of age ie halftimers they have introduced improved and new machinery of various kinds which altogether supersedes the employment of children ie under years f i i will mention one process as an illustration of this diminution in the number of children wherein by the addition of an apparatus called a piecing machine to existing machines the work of six or four halftimers according to the peculiarity of each machine can be performed by one young person over years the halftime system ‘stimulated’ the invention of the piecing machine” reports of insp of fact for st oct “wretch” is the recognised term in english political economy for the agricultural labourer “machinery can frequently not be employed until labour he means wages rises” ricardo lc p see “report of the social science congress at edinburgh” oct dr edward smith during the cotton crisis caused by the american civil war was sent by the english government to lancashire cheshire and other places to report on the sanitary condition of the cotton operatives he reported that from a hygienic point of view and apart from the banishment of the operatives from the factory atmosphere the crisis had several advantages the women now had sufficient leisure to give their infants the breast instead of poisoning them with “godfrey’s cordial” they had time to learn to cook unfortunately the acquisition of this art occurred at a time when they had nothing to cook but from this we see how capital for the purposes of its selfexpansion has usurped the labour necessary in the home of the family this crisis was also utilised to teach sewing to the daughters of the workmen in sewing schools an american revolution and a universal crisis in order that the working girls who spin for the whole world might learn to sew “the numerical increase of labourers has been great through the growing substitution of female for male and above all of childish for adult labour three girls of at wages of from shillings to shillings a week have replaced the one man of mature age of wages varying from shillings to shillings” th de quincey “the logic of political econ” london note to p since certain family functions such as nursing and suckling children cannot be entirely suppressed the mothers confiscated by capital must try substitutes of some sort domestic work such as sewing and mending must be replaced by the purchase of readymade articles hence the diminished expenditure of labour in the house is accompanied by an increased expenditure of money the cost of keeping the family increases and balances the greater income in addition to this economy and judgment in the consumption and preparation of the means of subsistence becomes impossible abundant material relating to these facts which are concealed by official political economy is to be found in the reports of the inspectors of factories of the children’s employment commission and more especially in the reports on public health in striking contrast with the great fact that the shortening of the hours of labour of women and children in english factories was exacted from capital by the male operatives we find in the latest reports of the children’s employment commission traits of the operative parents in relation to the traffic in children that are truly revolting and thoroughly like slavedealing but the pharisee of a capitalist as may be seen from the same reports denounces this brutality which he himself creates perpetuates and exploits and which he moreover baptises “freedom of labour” “infant labour has been called into aid even to work for their own daily bread without strength to endure such disproportionate toil without instruction to guide their future life they have been thrown into a situation physically and morally polluted the jewish historian has remarked upon the overthrow of jerusalem by titus that it

the habit of attributing the long hours of work in factories to the extensive kidnapping of children practised by capitalists in the infancy of the factory system on workhouses and orphanages by means of which robbery unresisting material for exploitation was procured thus for instance ficiden himself a manufacturer says “it is evident that the long hours of work were brought about by the circumstance of so great a number of destitute children being supplied from different parts of the country that the masters were independent of the hands and that having once established the custom by means of the miserable materials they had procured in this way they could impose it on their neighbours with the greater facility” j ficiden “the curse of the factory system” lond p i with reference

the working day by means of double sets of hands from the original hours to “it is selfevident that amid the ebbings and flowings of the markets and the alternate expansions and contractions of demand occasions will constantly recur in which the manufacturer may employ additional floating capital without employing additional fixed capital if additional quantities of raw material can be worked up

fact the workman must be in the factory at half past five if he come a few minutes late he is punished if he come minutes late he is not allowed to enter until after breakfast and thus loses a quarter of a day’s wage he must eat drink and sleep at word of command the despotic bell calls him from his bed calls him from breakfast and dinner and how does he fare in the mill there the master is the absolute lawgiver he makes what regulations he pleases he alters and makes additions to his code at pleasure and if he insert the veriest nonsense the courts say to the workman since you have entered into this contract voluntarily you must now carry it out these workmen are condemned to live from their ninth year till their death under this mental and bodily torture” f engels lc p sq what “the courts say” i will illustrate by two examples one occurs at sheffield at the end of in that town a workman had engaged himself for years in a steelworks in consequence of a quarrel with his employer he left the works and declared that under no circumstances would he work for that master any more he was prosecuted for breach of contract and condemned to two months’ imprisonment if the master break the contract he can be proceeded against only in a civil action and risks nothing but money damages after the workman has served his two months the master invites him to return to the works pursuant to the contract workman says no he has already been punished for the breach the master prosecutes again the court condemns again although one of the judges mr shee publicly denounces this as a legal monstrosity by which a man can periodically as long as he lives be punished over and over again for the same offence or crime this judgment was given not by the “great unpaid” the provincial dogberries but by one of the highest courts of justice in london — added in the th german edition — this has now been done away with with few exceptions eg when public gasworks are involved the worker in england is now put on an equal footing with the employer in case of breach of contract and can be sued only civilly — f e the second case occurs in wiltshire at the end of november about powerloom weavers in the employment of one harrup a cloth manufacturer at leower’s mill westbury leigh struck work because master harrup indulged in the agreeable habit of making deductions from their wages for being late in the morning d for minutes s for minutes and s d for ten minutes this is at the rate of s per hour and £ s d per diem while the wages of the weavers on the average of a year never exceeded s to s weekly harrup also appointed a boy to announce the starting time by a whistle which he often did before six o’clock in the morning and if the hands were not all there at the moment the whistle ceased the doors were closed and those hands who were outside were fined and as there was no clock on the premises the unfortunate hands were at the mercy of the young harrupinspired timekeeper the hands on strike mothers of families as well as girls offered to resume work if the timekeeper were replaced by a clock and a more reasonable scale of fines were introduced harrup summoned i women and girls before the magistrates for breach of contract to the utter indignation of all present they were each mulcted in a fine of d and s d for costs harrup was followed from the court by a crowd of people who hissed him a favourite operation with manufacturers is to punish the workpeople by deductions made from their wages on account of faults in the material worked on this method gave rise in to a general strike in the english pottery districts the reports of the ch empl com give cases where the worker not only receives no wages but becomes by means of his labour and of the penal regulations the debtor to boot of his worthy master the late cotton crisis also furnished edifying examples of the sagacity shown by the factory autocrats in making deductions from wages mr r baker the inspector of factories says “i have myself had lately to direct prosecutions against one cotton mill occupier for having in these pinching and painful times deducted d a piece from some of the young workers employed by him for the surgeon’s certificate for which he himself had only paid d when only allowed by the law to deduct d and by custom nothing at all and i have been informed of another who in order to keep without the law but to attain the same object charges the poor children who work for him a shilling each as a fee for learning them the art and mystery of cotton spinning so soon as they are declared by the surgeon fit and proper persons for that occupation there may therefore be undercurrent causes for such extraordinary exhibitions as strikes not only wherever they arise but particularly at such times as the present which without explanation render them inexplicable to the public understanding” he alludes here to a strike of powerloom weavers at darwen june “reports of insp of fact for april ” pp the reports always go beyond their official dates the protection afforded by the factory acts against dangerous machinery has had a beneficial effect “but there

increasing rates fingers must be quicker and defter in their movements to take up the broken thread for if placed with hesitation or carelessness they are sacrificed a large number of accidents are caused by the eagerness of the workpeople to get through their work expeditiously it must be remembered that it is of the highest importance to manufacturers that their machinery should be in motion ie producing yarns and goods every minute’s stoppage is not only a loss of power but of production and the workpeople are urged by the overlookers who are interested in the quantity of work turned off to keep the machinery in motion and it is no less important to those of the operatives who are paid by the weight or piece that the machines should be kept in motion consequently although it is strictly forbidden in many nay in most factories that machinery should be cleaned while in motion it is nevertheless the constant practice in most if not in all that the workpeople do unreproved pick out waste wipe rollers and wheels c while their frames are in motion thus from this cause only accidents have occurred during the six months although a great deal of cleaning is constantly going on day by day yet saturday is generally the day set apart for the thorough cleaning of the machinery and a great deal of this is done while the machinery is in motion” since cleaning is not paid for the workpeople seek to get done with it as speedily as possible hence “the number of accidents which occur on fridays and especially on saturdays is much larger than on any other day on the former day the excess is nearly per cent over the average number of the four first days of the week and on the latter day the excess is per cent over the average of the preceding five days or if the number of workinghours on saturday being taken into account — ½ hours on saturday as compared with ½ on other days — there is an excess of per cent on saturdays over the average of the other five days” “rep of

for instance as the loss of a finger being a trifling matter a workingman’s living and prospects depend so much upon his fingers that any loss of them is a very serious matter to him when i have heard

different firms as to which could turn out the neatest article shortly afterwards however a worse kind of competition sprang up namely that of underselling one another in the market the injurious consequences soon manifested themselves in reductions of wages and so sweepingly quick was the fall in the price of labour that many firms now pay only one half of the original wages and yet though wages sink lower and lower profits appear with each alteration in the scale of wages to increase” even bad times are utilised by the manufacturers for making exceptional profits by excessive lowering of wages ie by a direct robbery of the labourer’s means of subsistence one example it has reference to the crisis in the coventry silk weaving “from information i have received from manufacturers as

children thus eg mr snell reports it to be a common occurrence in somersetshire that when a poor person claims parish relief he is compelled to take his children from school mr wollarton the clergyman at feltham also tells of cases where all relief was denied to certain families “because they were sending their children to school” wherever handicraftmachines driven by men compete directly or indirectly with more developed machines driven by mechanical power a great change takes place with regard to the labourer who drives the machine at first the steamengine replaces this labourer afterwards he must replace the steamengine consequently the tension and the amount of tambourpower expended become monstrous and especially so in the case of the children who are condemned to this torture thus mr longe one of the commissioners found in coventry and the neighbourhood boys of from to years employed in driving the ribbonlooms not to mention younger children who had to drive

presented here the following remarks will have to suffice the act comprises textile mills here everything remains about as it was children more than years of age may work ½ hours a day or hours and saturday off young persons and women hours on days and at most ½ on saturday nontextile factories here the regulations are brought closer than before to those of no but there are still several exceptions which favour the capitalists and which in certain cases may be expanded by special permission of the home secretary workshops defined approximately as in the former act as for the children young workers and women employed there the workshops are about on a par with the nontextile factories but again conditions are easier in details workshops in which no children or young workers are employed but only persons of both sexes above the age of this category enjoy still easier conditions domestic workshops where only members of the family are employed in the family dwelling still more elastic regulations and simultaneously the restriction that the inspector may without special permission of the ministry or a court enter only rooms not used also for dwelling purposes and lastly unrestricted freedom for strawplaiting and lace and glovemaking by members of the family with all its defects this act together with the swiss federal factory law of march is still by far the best piece of legislation in this field a comparison of it with the said swiss federal law is of particular interest because it clearly demonstrates the merits and demerits of the two legislative methods — the english “historical” method which intervenes when occasion requires and the continental method which is built up on the traditions of the french revolution and generalises more unfortunately due to insufficient inspection personnel the english code is still largely a dead letter with regard to its application to workshops — f e “you divide the people into two hostile camps of clownish boors

volume to have developed from the point of view of natural science the negative ie destructive side of modern agriculture is one of liebig’s immortal merits his summary too of the history of agriculture although not free from gross errors contains flashes of light it is however to be regretted that he ventures on such haphazard assertions as the following “by greater pulverising and more frequent ploughing the circulation of air in the interior of porous soil is aided and the surface exposed to the action of the atmosphere is increased and renewed but it is easily seen that the increased yield of the land cannot be proportional to the labour spent on that land but increases in a much smaller proportion this law” adds liebig “was first enunciated by john stuart mill in his ‘principles of pol econ’ vol p as follows ‘that the produce of land increases caeteris paribus in a diminishing ratio to the increase of the labourers employed’ mill here introduces in an erroneous form the law enunciated by ricardo’s school for since the ‘decrease of the labourers employed’ kept even pace in england with the advance of agriculture the law discovered in and applied to england could have no application to that country at all events ‘is the universal law of agricultural industry’ this is very remarkable since mill was ignorant of the reason for this law” liebig lc bd i p and note apart from liebig’s wrong interpretation of the word “labour” by which word he understands something quite different from what political economy does it is in any case “very remarkable” that he should make mr john stuart mill the first propounder of a theory which was first published by james anderson in a smith’s days and was repeated in various works down to the beginning of the th century a theory which malthus that master in plagiarism the whole of his population theory is a shameless plagiarism appropriated to himself in which west developed at the same time as and independently of anderson which in the year was connected by ricardo with the general theory of value then made the round of the world as ricardo’s theory and in was vulgarised by james mill the father of john stuart

the solstice is the moment of the year when the nile begins to rise and it is the moment the egyptians have had to watch for with the greatest attention it was the evolution of the tropical year which

in the bengal presidency “there are no two countries which furnish an equal number of the necessaries of life in equal plenty and with the same quantity of labour men’s wants increase or diminish with the severity or temperateness of the climate they live in consequently the proportion of trade which the inhabitants of different countries are obliged to carry on through necessity cannot be the same nor is it practicable to ascertain the degree of variation farther than by the degrees of heat and cold from whence one may make this general conclusion that the quantity of labour required for a certain number of people is greatest in cold climates and least in hot ones for in the former men not only want more clothes but the earth more cultivating than in the latter” an essay on the

earlier editions of capital the quotation from john stuart mill “i assume throughoutof the labourer” had been given incorrectly the words “where the labourers and capitalists are separate classes” having been left out marx in a letter dated november pointed this out to danielson the russian translator of capital adding “the next two sentences viz ‘strange optical illusion to see everywhere a state of things which as yet exists only exceptionally on our earth but let us finish’ should be deleted and the following sentence substituted “mr mill is good enough to believe that this state of things is not an absolute necessity even in that economic system in which ‘labourers and capitalists are separate classes’” the substance of this note has been taken from the volksausgabe the quotation from mill is from his principles of political economy book ii chap xv j st mill principles of pol econ lond p passim note in the rd german edition — the case considered at pages is here of course omitted — f e to this third law macculloch has made amongst others this absurd addition that a rise in surplusvalue unaccompanied by a fall in the value of labourpower can occur through the abolition of taxes payable by the capitalist the abolition of such taxes makes no change whatever in the quantity of surplusvalue that the capitalist extorts at firsthand from the labourer it alters only the proportion in which that surplusvalue is divided between himself and third persons it consequently makes no alteration whatever in the relation between surplusvalue and value of labourpower maccullochs exception therefore proves only his misapprehension of the rule a misfortune that as often happens to him in the vulgarisation of ricardo as it does to j b say in the vulgarisation of adam smith “when an alteration takes place in the productiveness of industry and that either more or less is produced by a given quantity of labour and capital the proportion of wages may obviously vary whilst the quantity which that proportion represents remains the same or the quantity may vary whilst the proportion remains the same” “outlines of political economy c” p “all things being equal the english manufacturer can turn out a considerably larger amount of work in a given time than a foreign manufacturer so much as to counterbalance the difference of the working days between hours a week

quantitatively the length of the working day in continental factories “there are compensating circumstances which the working of the ten hours act has brought to light” “rep of insp of fact for st oct

admirable as a temporary relief but if they were constantly in action effects of a similar kind would result from them as from the population of a country being pushed to the very extreme limits of its food” malthus “inquiry into the nature and progress of rent” lond p note all honour to malthus that he lays stress on the lengthening of the hours of labour a fact to which he elsewhere in his pamphlet draws attention while ricardo and others in face of the most notorious facts make invariability in the length of the working day the groundwork of all their investigations but the conservative interests which malthus served prevented him from seeing that an unlimited prolongation of the working day combined with an extraordinary development of machinery and the exploitation of women and children must inevitably have made a great portion of the workingclass “supernumerary” particularly whenever the war should have ceased and the monopoly of england in the markets of the world should have come to an end it was of course far more convenient and much more in conformity with the interests of the ruling classes whom malthus adored like a true priest to explain this “overpopulation” by the eternal laws of nature rather than by the historical laws of capitalist production “a principal cause of the increase of capital during the war proceeded from the greater exertions and perhaps the greater privations of the labouring classes the most numerous in every society more women and children were compelled by necessitous circumstances to enter upon laborious occupations and former workmen were from the same cause obliged to devote a greater portion of their time to increase production” essays on pol econ in which are illustrated the principal causes of

favorably marx judged his predecessors whenever he found in them real progress or new and sound ideas the subsequent publications of robertus’ letters to rud meyer has shown that the above acknowledgement by marx wants restricting to some extent in those letters this passage occurs “capital must be rescued not only from labor but from itself and that will be best effected by treating the acts of the industrial capitalist as economic and political functions that have been delegated to him with his capital and by treating his profit as a form of salary because we still know no other social organisation but salaries may be regulated and may also be reduced if they take too much from wages the irruption of marx into society as i may call his book must be warded off altogether

product which merely replaces the constant capital advanced is of course left out in this calculation mr l de lavergne a blind admirer of england is inclined to estimate the share of the capitalist too low rather than too high all welldeveloped forms of capitalist production being forms of cooperation nothing is of course easier than to make abstraction from their antagonistic character and to transform them by a word into some form of free association as is done by a de laborde in “de l’esprit d’association dans tous les intérêts de la communauté paris h carey the yankee occasionally performs this conjuring trick with like success even with the relations resulting from slavery although the physiocrats could not penetrate the mystery of surplusvalue yet this much was clear to them

turgot “réflexions sur la formation et la distribution des richesses” p “mrricardo ingeniously enough avoids a difficulty which on a first view threatens to encumber his doctrine — that value depends on the quantity of labour employed in production if this principle is rigidly adhered to it follows that the value of labour depends on the quantity of labour employed in producing it — which is evidently absurd by a dexterous turn therefore mr ricardo makes the value of labour depend on the quantity of labour required to produce wages or to give him the benefit of his own language he maintains that the value of labour is to be estimated by the quantity of labour required to produce wages by which he means the quantity of labour required to produce the money or commodities given to the labourer this is similar to saying that the value of cloth is estimated not by the quantity of labour bestowed on its production but by the quantity of labour bestowed on the production of the silver for which the cloth is exchanged” — “a critical dissertation on the nature c of value” pp “if you call labour a commodity it is not like a commodity which is first produced in order to exchange and then brought to market where it must exchange with other commodities according to the respective quantities of each which there may be in the market at the time labour is created the moment it is brought to market nay it is brought to market before it is created” — “observations on certain verbal disputes” c pp “treating labour as a commodity and capital the produce of labour as another then if the values of these two commodities were regulated by equal quantities of labour a given amount of labour would exchange for that quantity of capital which had been produced by the same amount of labour antecedent labour would exchange for the same amount as present labour but the value of labour in relation to other commodities is determined not by equal quantities of labour” — e g wakefield in his edition of adam smith’s “wealth of nations” vol i london p note “there has to be a new agreement” a new edition of the social contract “that whenever there is an exchange of work done for work to be done the latter” the capitalist “is to receive a higher value than the former” the worker — simonde de sismondi “de la richesse commerciale” geneva vol i p “labour the exclusive standard of value the creator of all wealth no commodity” thomas hodgskin “popul polit econ” p on the other hand the attempt to explain such expressions as merely poetic license only shows the impotence of the analysis hence in answer to proudhon’s phrase “labour is called value not as being a commodity itself but in view of the values supposed to be potentially embodied in it the value of labour is a figurative expression” c i have remarked “in labour commodity which is a frightful reality he proudhon sees nothing but a grammatical ellipsis the whole of existing society then based upon labour commodity is henceforth based upon a poetic license on a figurative expression does society desire to eliminate all the inconveniences which trouble it it has only to eliminate all the illsounding terms let it change the language and for that it has only to address itself to the academy and ask it for a new edition of its dictionary” karl marx “misère de la philosophie” pp it is naturally still more convenient to understand by value nothing at all then one can without difficulty subsume everything under this category thus eg j b say “what is value” answer “that which a thing is worth and what is “price answer “the value of a thing expressed in money” and why has agriculture a value answer “because one sets a price on it” therefore value is what a thing is worth and the land has its “value” because its value is “expressed in money” this is anyhow a very simple way of explaining the why and the wherefore of things cf “zur kritik c” p where i state that in the portion of that work

price of labour determined” west however dismisses with mere banalities this is perceived by the fanatical representative of the industrial bourgeoisie of the th century the author of the “essay on trade and commerce” often quoted by us although he puts the matter in a confused way “it is the quantity of labour and not the price of it” he means by this the nominal daily or weekly wages “that is determined by the price of provisions and other necessaries reduce the price of necessaries very low and of course you reduce the quantity of labour in proportion master manufacturers know that there are various ways of raising and felling the price of labour besides that of altering its nominal amount” op cit pp in his “three lectures on the rate of wages” london in which n w senior uses west’s work without mentioning it he says “the labourer is principally interested in the amount of wages” p that is to say the labourer is principally interested in what he receives the nominal sum of his wages not in that which he gives the amount of labour the effect of such an abnormal lessening of employment is quite different from that of a general reduction of the working day enforced by law the former has nothing to do with the absolute length of the working day and may occur just as well in a working day of as of hours the normal price of labour is in the first case calculated on the labourer working hours in the second case on his working hours a day on the average the result is therefore the same if he in the one case is employed only for ½ in the other only for hours “the rate

by the capitalist or added to the fund that supplies his private consumption i have retained this double meaning because it harmonises with the language of the english and french economists taking the usurer that oldfashioned but ever renewed specimen of the capitalist for his text luther shows very aptly that the love of power is an element in the desire to get rich “the heathen were able by the light of reason to conclude that a usurer is a doubledyed thief and murderer we christians however hold them in such honour that we fairly worship them for the sake of their money whoever eats up robs and steals the nourishment of another that man commits as great a murder so far as in him lies as he who starves a man or utterly undoes him such does a usurer and sits the while safe on his stool

backwards into his den but hercules shall hear the cry of the oxen and of his prisoners and shall seek cacus even in cliffs and among rocks and shall set the oxen loose again from the villain for cacus means the villain that is a pious usurer and steals robs eats everything and will not own that he has done it and thinks no one will find him out because the oxen drawn backwards into his den make it seem from their footprints that they have been let out so the usurer would deceive the world as though he were of use and gave the world oxen which he however rends and eats all alone and

properly grasped this weighty element of reproduction as may be seen in ricardo he says eg whatever the change in productive power “a million men always produce in manufactures the same value” this is accurate if the extension and degree of intensity of their labour are given but it does not prevent this ricardo overlooks in certain conclusions he draws a million men with different powers of productivity in their labour turning into products very different masses of the means of production and therefore preserving in their products very different masses of value in consequence of which the values of the products yielded may vary considerably ricardo has it may be noted in passing tried in vain to make clear to j b say by that very example the difference between use value which he here calls wealth or material riches and exchangevalue say answers “quant à la difficulté qu’élève mr ricardo en disant que par des procédés mieux entendus un million de personnes peuvent produire deux fois trois fois autant de richesses sans produire plus de valeurs cette difficulté n’est pas une lorsque l’on considére ainsi qu’on le doit la production comme un échange dans lequel on donne les services productifs de son travail de sa terre et de ses capitaux pour obtenir des produits c’est par le moyen de ces services productifs que nous acquérons tous les produits qui sont au monde or nous sommes d’autant plus riches nos services productifs ont d’autant plus de valeur qu’ils obtiennent dans l’échange appelé production une plus grande quantité de choses utiles” as for the difficulty raised by ricardo when he says that by using better methods of production a million people can produce two or three times as much wealth without producing any more value this difficulty disappears when one bears in mind as one should that production is like an exchange in which a man contributes the productive services of his labour his land and his capital in order to obtain products it is by means of these productive services that we acquire all the products existing in the world therefore we are richer our productive services have the more value the greater the quantity of useful things they bring in through the exchange which is called production j b say “lettres à m malthus” paris pp the “difficulté” — it exists for him not for ricardo — that say means to clear up is this why does not the exchangevalue of the use values increase when their quantity increases in consequence of increased productive power of labour answer the difficulty is met by calling use value exchangevalue if you please exchangevalue is a thing that is connected one way or another with exchange if therefore production is called an exchange of labour and means of production against the product it is clear as day that you obtain more exchangevalue in proportion as the production yields more use value in other words the more use values eg stockings a working day yields to the stockingmanufacturer the richer is he in stockings suddenly however say recollects that “with a greater quantity” of stockings their “price” which of course has nothing to do with their exchangevalue falls “parce que la concurrence les les producteurs oblige à donner les produits pour ce qu’ils leur coûtent because competition obliges them the producers to sell their products for what they cost to make but whence does the profit come if the capitalist sells the commodities at costprice never mind say declares that in consequence of increased productivity every one now receives in return for a given equivalent two pairs of stockings instead of one as before the result he arrives at is precisely that proposition of ricardo that he aimed at disproving after this mighty effort of thought he triumphantly apostrophises malthus in the words “telle est monsieur la doctrine bien liée sans laquelle il est impossible je le déclare d’expliquer les plus grandes difficultés de l’économie politique et notamment comment il se peut qu’une nation soit plus riche lorsque ses produits diminuent de valeur quoique la richesse soit de la valeur” this sir is the wellfounded doctrine without which it is impossible i say to explain the greatest difficulties in political economy and in particular to explain why it is that a nation can be richer when its products fall in value even though wealth is value l c p an english economist remarks upon the conjuring tricks of the same nature that appear in say’s “lettres” “those affected ways of talking make up in general that which m say is pleased to call his doctrine and which he earnestly urges malthus to teach at hertford as it is already taught ‘dans plusieurs parties de l’europe’ he says ‘si vous trouvez une physionomie de paradoxe à toutes ces propositions voyez les choses qu’elles expriment et j’ose croire qu’elles vous paraîtront fort simples et fort raisonnables’ in numerous parts of europe if all those propositions appear paradoxical to

food raw materials and tools should be previously augmented which is in fact maintaining that no increase of production can take place without a previous increase or in other words that an increase is impossible” s bailey “money and its vicissitudes” pp and bailey criticises the dogma mainly from the point of view of the process of circulation john stuart mill in his “principles of political economy” says “the really exhausting and the really repulsive labours instead of being better paid than others are almost invariably paid the worst of all the more revolting the occupation the more certain it is to receive the minimum of remuneration the hardships and the earnings instead of being directly proportional as in any just arrangements of society they would be are generally in an inverse ratio to one another” to avoid misunderstanding let me say that although men like john stuart mill are to blame for the contradiction between their traditional economic dogmas and their modern tendencies it would be very wrong to class them with the herd of vulgar economic apologists h fawcett professor of political economy at cambridge “the economic position of the british labourer” london p i must here remind the reader that the categories “variable and constant capital” were first used by me political economy since the time of adam smith has confusedly mixed up the essential

emigrants who are in great part not labourers the sons of farmers make up a great part of them the additional capital annually transported abroad to be put out at interest is in much greater

nothing more than a schoolboyish superficial plagiary of de foe sir james steuart townsend franklin wallace c and does not contain a single sentence thought out by himself the great sensation this pamphlet caused was due solely to party interest the french revolution had found passionate defenders in the united kingdom the “principle of population” slowly worked out in the eighteenth century and then in the midst of a great social crisis proclaimed with drums and trumpets as the infallible antidote to the teachings of condorcet c was greeted with jubilance by the english oligarchy as the great destroyer of all hankerings after human development malthus hugely astonished at his success gave himself to stuffing into his book materials superficially compiled and adding to it new matter not discovered but annexed by him note further although malthus was a parson of the english state church he had taken the monastic vow of celibacy — one of the conditions of holding a fellowship in protestant cambridge university “socios collegiorum maritos esse non permittimus sed statim postquam quis uxorem duxerit socius collegii desinat esse” “reports of cambridge university commission” p this circumstance favourably distinguishes malthus from the other protestant parsons who have shuffled off the command enjoining celibacy of the priesthood and have taken “be fruitful and multiply” as their special biblical mission in such a degree that they generally contribute to the increase of population to a really unbecoming extent whilst they preach at the same time to the labourers the “principle of population” it is characteristic that the economic fall of man the adam’s apple the urgent appetite “the checks which tend to blunt the shafts of cupid” as parson townsend waggishly puts it that this delicate question was and is monopolised by the reverends of protestant theology or rather of the protestant church with the exception of the venetian monk ortes an original and clever writer most of the population theory teachers are protestant parsons for instance bruckner “théorie du système animal” leyde in which the whole subject of the modern population theory is exhausted and to which the passing quarrel between quesnay and his pupil the elder mirabeau furnished ideas on the same topic then parson wallace parson townsend parson malthus and his pupil the archparson thomas

rev mr tucker a notable economist of his time excused himself for meddling with the things of mammon later on and in truth with this very “principle of population” struck the hour of the protestant parsons petty who regarded the population as the basis of wealth and was like adam smith an outspoken foe to parsons says as if he had a presentiment of their bungling interference “that religion best flourishes when the priests are most mortified as was before said of the law which best flourisheth when lawyers have least to do” he advises the protestant priests therefore if they once for all will not follow the apostle paul and “mortify” themselves by celibacy “not to breed more churchmen than the benefices as they now stand shared out will receive that is to say if there be places for about twelve thousand in england and wales it will not be safe to breed up ministers for then the twelve thousand which are unprovided for will seek ways how to get themselves a livelihood which they cannot do more easily than by persuading the people that the twelve thousand incumbents do poison or starve their souls and misguide them in their way to heaven” petty “a treatise of taxes and contributions” london p adam smith’s position with the protestant priesthood of his time is shown by the following in “a letter to a smith lld on the life death and philosophy of his friend david hume by one of the people called christians” th edition oxford dr horne bishop of norwich reproves adam smith because in a published letter to mr strahan he “embalmed his friend david” sc hume because he told the world how “hume amused himself on his deathbed with lucian and whist” and because he even had the impudence to write of hume “i have always considered him both in his lifetime and since his death as approaching as nearly to the idea of a perfectly wise and virtuous man as perhaps the nature of human frailty will permit” the bishop cries out in a passion “is it right in you sir to hold up to our view as ‘perfectly wise and virtuous’ the character and conduct of one who seems to have been possessed with an incurable antipathy to all that is called religion and who strained every nerve to explode suppress and extirpate the spirit of it among men that its very name if he could effect it might no more be had in remembrance” l c p “but let not the lovers of truth be discouraged atheism cannot be of long continuance” p adam smith “had the atrocious wickedness to propagate atheism through the land viz by his “theory of moral sentiments” upon the whole doctor your meaning is good but i think you will not succeed this time you would persuade us by the example of david hume esq that atheism is the only cordial for low spirits and the proper antidote against the fear of death you may smile over babylon in ruins and congratulate the hardened pharaoh on his overthrow in the red sea” l c pp one orthodox individual amongst adam smith’s college friends writes after his death “smith’s wellplaced affection for hume hindered him from being a christian when he met with honest men whom he liked he would believe almost anything they said had he been a friend of the worthy ingenious horrox he would have believed that the moon some times disappeared in a clear sky without the interposition of a cloud he approached to republicanism in his political principles” “the bee” by james anderson vols vol pp edinburgh parson thomas chalmers has his suspicions as to adam smith having invented the category of “unproductive labourers” solely for the protestant parsons in spite of their blessed work in the vineyard of the lord “the limit however to the employment of both the operative and the labourer is the same namely the possibility of the employer realising a profit on the produce of their industry if the rate of wages is such as to reduce the master’s gains below the average profit of capital he will cease to employ them or he will only employ them on condition of submission to a reduction of wages” john wade l c p note by the institute of marxismleninism to the russian edition the ms in the first case says “little” and in the second case “much” the correction

depends on the increase of circulating and not of fixed capital were it true that the proportion between these two sorts of capital is the same at all times and in all circumstances then indeed it follows that the number of labourers employed is in proportion to the wealth of the state but such a proposition has not the semblance of probability as arts are cultivated and civilisation is extended fixed capital bears a larger and larger proportion to circulating capital the amount of fixed capital employed in the production of a piece of british muslin is at least a hundred probably a

uniform character but a dual character that in the selfsame relations in which wealth is produced poverty is produced also that in the selfsame relations in which there is a development of productive

despotism bureaucracy and feudalism may be seen from the following quotation from his admirer mirabeau “le lin fait donc une des grandes richesses du cultivateur dans le nord de l’allemagne malheureusement pour l’espèce humaine ce n’est qu’une ressource contre la misère et non un moyen de bienêtre les impôts directs les corvées les servitudes de tout genre écrasent le cultivateur

marchands qui pourraient le lui livrer au meilleur prix toutes ces causes le ruinent insensiblement et il se trouverait hors d’état de payer les impôts directs à l’échéance sans la filerie elle lui offre une ressource en occupant utilement sa femme ses enfants ses servants ses valets et luimême mais quelle pénible vie même aidée de ce secours en été il travaille comme un forçat au labourage et à la récolte il se couche à heures et se lève à deux pour suffire aux travaux en hiver il devrait réparer ses forces par un plus grand repos mais il manquera de grains pour le pain et les semailles s’il se défait des denrées qu’il faudrait vendre pour payer les impôts il faut donc filer pour suppléer à ce vide il faut y apporter la plus grande assiduité aussi le paysan se couchetil en hiver à minuit une heure et se lève à cinq ou six ou bien il se couche à neuf et se lève à deux et cela tous les jours de la vie si ce n’est le dimanche ces excès de veille et de travail usent la nature humaine et de là vient qu’hommes et femmes vieillissent beaucoup plutôt dans les campagnes que dans les villes” flax represents one of the greatest sources of wealth for the peasant of north germany unfortunately for the human race this is only a resource against misery and not a means towards wellbeing direct taxes forced labour service obligations of all kinds crush the german peasant especially as he still has to pay indirect taxes on everything he buys and to complete his ruin he dare not sell his produce where and as he wishes he dare not buy what he needs from the merhcants who could sell it to him at a cheaper price he is slowly ruined by all those factors and when the dirct taxes fall due he would find himself incapable of paying them without his spinningwheel it offers him a last resort while providing useful occupation for his wife his children his maids his farmhands and himself but what a painful life he leads even with this extra resource in summer he works like a convict with the plough and at harvest he goes to bed at nine o’clock and rises at two to get through all his work in winter he ought to be recovering his strength by sleeping longer but he would run short of corn for his bread and next year’s sowing if he got rid of the products that he needs to sell in order to pay the taxes he therefore has to spin to fill up this gap and indeed he must do so most assiduously thus the peasant goes to bed at midnight or one o’clock in winter and gets up at five or six or he goes to bed at nine and gets up at two and this he does every day of his life except sundays these excessively short hours of sleep and long hours of work consume a person’s strength and hence it happens that men and women age much more in the country than in the towns mirabeau

were the most convenient means for getting an income without expenditure a deerforest in place of a sheepwalk was a common change in the highlands the landowners turned out the sheep as they once turned out the men from their estates and welcomed the new tenants — the wild beasts and the feathered birds one can walk from the earl of dalhousie’s estates in forfarshire to john o’groats without ever leaving forest land in many of these woods the fox the wild cat the marten the polecat the weasel and the alpine hare are common whilst the rabbit the squirrel and the rat have lately made their way into the country immense tracts of land much of which is described in the statistical account of scotland as having a pasturage in richness and extent of very superior description are thus shut out from all cultivation and improvement and are solely devoted to the sport of a few persons for a very brief period of the year” the london economist of june says “amongst the items of news in a scotch paper of last week we read ’one of the finest sheep farms in sutherlandshire for which a rent of £ a year was recently offered on the expiry of the existing lease this year is to be converted into a deerforest’ here we see the modern instincts of feudalism operating pretty much as they did when the norman conqueror destroyed villages to create the new forest two millions of acres totally laid waste embracing within their area some of the most fertile lands of scotland the natural grass of glen tilt was among the most nutritive in the county of perth the deerforest of ben aulder was by far the best grazing ground in the wide district of badenoch a part of the black mount forest was the best pasture for blackfaced sheep in scotland some idea of the ground laid waste for purely sporting purposes in scotland may be formed from the fact that it embraced an area larger than the whole county of perth the resources of the forest of ben aulder might give some idea of the loss sustained from the forced desolations the ground would pasture sheep and as it was not more than onethirtieth part of the old forest ground in scotland it might c all that forest land is as totally

the farm servants of silesia had in meat twice a week whilst even in our century districts are known where they have it only three times a year further wages after the war were higher than in the

conventions seront déclarées inconstitutionnelles attentatoires à la liberté et à la declaration des droits de l’homme c” felony therefore as in the old labourstatutes as the abolition of any form of association between citizens of the same estate and profession is one of the foundations of the french constitution it is forbidden to reestablish them under any pretext or in any form whatever they might be citizens belonging to the same profession craft or trade have joint discussions and make joint decisions with the intention of refusing together to perform their trade or insisting together on providing the services of their trade or their labours only at a particular price then the said deliberations and agreements shall be declared unconstitutional derogatory to liberty and the

increase in wages and were obliged to furnish the extra amount at first out of their profits and then out of their very capital a considerable amount of planters have been ruined as a result while
